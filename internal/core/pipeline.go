// Build runs the whole pipeline: validate, preflight, prepare, compile and

//
// The stage order is fixed and every stage but one is a barrier, because
// every stage consumes the previous one's output:
//
//  1. Normalize + Validate the request, and check the ports are wired. No
//     subprocess and no packet leaves the machine before this passes.
//  2. Compiler.Preflight — bun present and new enough, adapter installed,
//     project shaped like a SvelteKit project.
//  3. BaseImageResolver.Resolve — one call for every platform at once, and
//     the libc compatibility gate. Done before any compile so that an
//     incompatible base costs a round trip rather than two 90 MB builds.
//     Signature verification is deliberately *not* part of this call (see
//     stage 5) — Resolve only pins the digest that everything downstream,
//     including the remote-cache key, needs.
//     3.5 The base-image CVE scan and the pre-build source secret scan are
//     dispatched concurrently and joined before the remote-cache result
//     (stage 4.5) may be acted on. They overlap the cache lookup rather
//     than preceding it, but they are NOT deferred past it: unlike the
//     base-image signature check, a CVE scan queries a live vulnerability
//     database whose answer for a fixed digest changes over time, so
//     skipping it on a cache hit would let a build that fails today
//     silently promote release tags tomorrow.
//  4. --dry-run stops here and reports the plan, after synchronously
//     running both of those scans and verifying the base image signature,
//     so a dry run still fails fast on an invalid one.
//  5. Compiler.Prepare — the SvelteKit build — runs concurrently (via
//     errgroup) with BaseImageResolver.VerifyBaseImage,
//     NativeInspector.Inspect and every platform's Bun runtime resolve,
//     since a cache miss needs all of them to succeed before publishing
//     but none of them needs to finish before Prepare can start. Prepare itself still runs exactly once: it writes
//     into ProjectDir/.svelte-kit and the port documents it as unsafe to
//     run concurrently with another Prepare for the same project. A
//     failure in either concurrent check cancels the in-flight Prepare
//     (tearing down the bun subprocess tree, not just abandoning a
//     goroutine) and fails the build before fan-out is ever reached — first
//     error wins via errgroup, not errors.Join, so if two fail at genuinely
//     overlapping times only one error surfaces and which one is not
//     deterministic. A cache hit (stage 3.5, ahead of this stage) skips
//     VerifyBaseImage and Inspect entirely — neither check has anything
//     left to gate once nothing is going to be built from source or from
//     the base image.
//  6. Fan out: per platform Compile → Supervisor.Binary → Packager.Build,
//     plus the single SBOM scan. This is the only other parallel section
//     and it is where most of the wall-clock time is.
//  7. Packager.Index when more than one platform was built.
//  8. --print-manifest stops here and emits the manifest and config JSON.
//  9. Publish through whichever of Registry / LocalLoader / TarballWriter the
//     output mode selected.
//  10. Registry.AttachSBOM, push mode only, after the subject exists.
//     10.5 Signing, push mode only, when a signing key is available: the SLSA
//     provenance statement is DSSE-signed and attached as .att, and the
//     digest is Cosign-signed and attached as .sig — for the published
//     digest AND every per-platform manifest digest — then every attachment
//     is fetched back from the registry and cryptographically verified
//     (post-push self-verification) before the build may report success.
//     Subjects are signed concurrently and then verified concurrently, in
//     two separate phases: every attach completes before any read-back
//     starts, which is what makes the read-back meaningful.
//     With signing enabled but no key, the image pushes unsigned with an
//     unmistakable warning and BuildResult.Signing records the fact;
//     Signing.Require turns that into a validation-time failure instead.
//  11. Write the published reference to Deps.Stdout, alone.
//
// ctx is threaded into every port call and is checked between stages, so a
// Ctrl-C aborts an in-flight compile or push instead of letting it finish.

	//     OutputDir/prerendered (no server component at all) — scanning
	//     just those two avoids false "coverage" of files this strategy
	//     never packages.
	//   - StrategyExe's ACTUAL shipped artifact is the single native
	//     executable Compile produces below, by bundling
	//     prep.EntrypointPath via `bun build --compile`. Its full
	//     pre-compile bundled-JS input is therefore prep.OutputDir AND

	//     uncovered at both stages.

	//     parity with layered/static: it catches everything already baked
	//     into the JS by Prepare — every example in this feature's bug
	//     report (env baking, Vite define, a malicious dependency's
	//     chunk) — but NOT anything a bunfig.toml preload plugin or a
	//     `with { type: "macro" }` import could inject only during the
	//     Compile step itself. Scanning the compiled executable instead
	//     was considered and rejected: it is a single, non-line-oriented,
	//     size-unbounded binary blob whose embedded string constants may
