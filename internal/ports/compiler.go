// Package ports defines the driven-side contract of Pokkum: the interfaces that
// the application core calls out through, together with every value type that
// crosses that boundary.
//
// # Type-placement convention
//
// ports is the LEAF package of the internal tree. It imports the standard
// library and github.com/google/go-containerregistry/pkg/v1 and nothing else —
// in particular it never imports internal/core or any adapter. internal/core
// imports ports; adapters import ports (and internal/core for the sentinel
// errors). The dependency graph is therefore acyclic in exactly one direction:
//
//	cmd ──▶ core ──▶ ports ◀── adapters
//	         └────────────────────┘  (adapters also import core for errors)
//
// The consequence is that shared boundary vocabulary (Platform, Artifact,
// SBOMFormat, BaseImagePreset, the per-port request/response structs and the
// runtime contract constants) is declared HERE, not in core. core re-exports the
// four shared value types as type aliases so that core-facing code may spell
// them core.Platform, core.Artifact, and so on; an alias is the same type, so
// there is never a conversion and never an ambiguity about which one to use.
//
// The split of responsibility is:
//
//   - ports holds pure vocabulary and behaviour that cannot fail: String, ToV1,
//     BunTarget, Valid. It declares no sentinel errors.
//   - core holds policy: parsing (ParsePlatform, ParseSBOMFormat, ...),
//     validation (BuildRequest.Validate) and every sentinel error.
//
// This inverts the naive "structs in core" arrangement, and deliberately so: the
// application service core.Build is the sole consumer of these interfaces, so
// core must be able to import ports. Had ports imported core for its request
// structs, core could not have imported ports back and the pipeline would have
// been forced to redeclare all seven interfaces locally. One import direction,
// one declaration of every type.
//
// # Contract rules that apply to every interface in this package
//
//   - Every method takes context.Context as its first parameter and must honour
//     cancellation. Long-running work (subprocesses, network I/O) must abort and
//     return a wrapped ctx.Err() when the context is done.
//   - Implementations must be safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines
//     unless the interface's doc comment says otherwise. core fans out across
//     platforms and will call the same Compiler/Packager value in parallel.
//   - Implementations must be deterministic: given identical requests, including
//     an identical SourceDateEpoch, they must produce byte-identical output.
//     Never read the wall clock, a random source, the environment or the working
//     directory inside an adapter; take it from the request.
//   - Errors must wrap a sentinel from internal/core with %w. See core/errors.go
//     for the wrapping convention.
//   - A returned pointer or slice belongs to the caller; implementations must
//     not retain or mutate it after returning.
