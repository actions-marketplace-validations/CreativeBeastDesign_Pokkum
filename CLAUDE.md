# Pokkum — AI Agent Instructions & Guidelines (Claude Code)

Welcome to **Pokkum**, a Go-based zero-dependency OCI container image compiler for SvelteKit applications.

This document defines the core guidelines, architectural invariants, verification protocols, and **planning/orchestration policy** for Claude Code working on this codebase.

---

## 1. Serena MCP as the Source of Truth

**Serena MCP** manages the persistent project memory graph for Pokkum.

### Startup Protocol

At the beginning of any non-trivial task, agents **MUST**:

1. Access Serena MCP and read `mem:core` using the `read_memory` tool.
2. Follow references to domain-specific memories (`mem:conventions`, `mem:tech_stack`, `mem:telemetry`, `mem:task_completion`, `mem:self_review_checklist`) as needed for the task.

### Pre-Task Checklist

Before writing any code, in addition to the Serena startup protocol above:

- **Route through `mem:lessons_index` first, then `Lessons.md`.** `Lessons.md` is 100+ post-mortems; grepping it works only when you guess the same word the author used. `mem:lessons_index` routes by **category** instead — ask "what kind of change am I about to make?" (a fan-out, a config field, a cache key, an outbound call, a deletion) and read the entries it lists for that class. Then grep `Lessons.md` for the specific packages/files/functions you are about to touch. A prior incident in the same area is a strong signal of being about to repeat it — read that entry's root cause and preventative rule *before* writing a line of code, not after. See the Root Cause Analysis subsection under Section 5 for how entries are structured, and regenerate the index when you add an entry.

### Keeping Serena Memories Up-to-Date

Serena's memory graph is a living repository. Agents **MUST** update Serena memories whenever:

- Architectural patterns or interface boundaries change.
- New dependencies, CLI flags, or base image defaults are introduced.
- Build/verification protocols or conventions are updated.

Use Serena's `write_memory` or `edit_memory` tools to keep memories concise, invariant-focused, and accurate.

### Symbolic Tool Primacy

- **Codebase Exploration**: Use `get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol`, or `search_for_pattern` to locate relevant symbols instead of reading whole files.
- **Refactoring & Edits**: Use reference-aware refactoring tools (`rename_symbol`, `safe_delete_symbol`, `replace_symbol_body`) when modifying symbol definitions.
- **Minimizing Context**: Avoid reading entire source files when viewing specific symbol bodies is sufficient.

---

## 2. Core Architectural Invariants

### Hexagonal Architecture Boundaries

- **`internal/ports`**: Leaf node of the internal dependency graph. It imports stdlib + `go-containerregistry/pkg/v1` only. It must **NEVER** import `internal/core` or any concrete adapter (`internal/adapters/*`).
- **`internal/core`**: Domain logic layer. Imports `internal/ports` and standard library. Re-exports port vocabulary as type aliases (e.g. `core.Platform = ports.Platform`).
- **Automated Purity Verification**: `internal/architecture_test.go` enforces boundary rules via AST analysis and executes automatically during `go test ./internal/...` (or via `make check-arch`).

### Shared Utility Package Convention (`utils`)

- **Non-Adapter Utilities**: Any shared or internal helper module that does not implement a concrete Hexagonal port interface MUST be appended with a `utils` suffix (e.g., `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils`, `internal/adapters/ignoreutils`).
- **Utility Package Sentinel**: Utility packages SHOULD declare `const IsUtilityPackage = true` to explicitly distinguish them from port adapter implementations.

### Bit-for-Bit OCI Reproducibility

- **Zero Clock Access**: Adapters must **never** call `time.Now()` or read system clocks. All file timestamps and tar headers must derive from `req.SourceDateEpoch`.
- **Deterministic Ordering**: Directory traversals, tar headers, and map keys must be explicitly sorted before archiving or building layers.

### Zero-Mutation Build Sandbox

- Code injections (such as SvelteKit adapter configuration or OpenTelemetry instrumentation) must occur in `.pokkum/` virtual memory / sandbox space.
- User-authored source files in the working directory must **never** be overwritten or mutated during build or image compilation.

### Toolchain Version Stability

- **Never downgrade the Go version.** `go.mod`'s `go` directive and every `go-version:` pin in `.github/workflows/*.yml` must never decrease — only hold steady or raise. If a change appears to require lowering either (a tool that only supports an older Go, an editor/IDE mismatch, a dependency conflict), that is a signal to fix the actual incompatibility or ask the user, not to quietly regress the pin. Check both `git diff -- go.mod` and `git diff -- '.github/workflows/*.yml'` for a lowered version before declaring any change complete.
- **Build and test with the toolchain `go.mod` declares, not whichever Go is installed.** CI resolves its version from `go.mod` (`go-version-file`), so a machine running a *newer* Go silently disagrees with it — and the disagreement surfaces as something else entirely. Both halves bit this repo on 2026-09-01: `make supervisor static-server` on Go 1.27 produced embedded PID-1 blobs that CI's 1.26.6 rebuild rejected, and `packager`'s golden digests failed locally while passing in CI, reading exactly like a deliberate config change nobody re-recorded. **Before bisecting a digest/golden failure, or re-recording any golden, re-run it as `GOTOOLCHAIN=go$(awk '/^go [0-9]/{print $2}' go.mod) go test ./...`.** Re-recording a golden under an unpinned toolchain hard-breaks CI and makes a digest no released build produces the canonical one. The `supervisor`/`static-server` Makefile targets pin `GOTOOLCHAIN` themselves; anything else digest-affecting must too.

---

## 3. Go Engineering & Quality Standards

- **Error Handling**: Always wrap errors with clear context (`fmt.Errorf("sveltekitutils adapter: %w", err)`). Use sentinel errors defined in `internal/core` for domain error matching.
- **Interface Segregation**: Define narrow interfaces in `internal/ports`. Keep adapter-internal helper structs unexported.
- **Concurrency Safety**: Ensure layer tarball compression and multi-arch OCI image manifest assembly are safe for concurrent execution.
- **Zero Fake Implementations (Verification of Real Code)**:
  - Fake, mock, or placeholder implementations must **ALWAYS** be flagged explicitly and must **NEVER** be assumed or reported as fully implemented.
  - Before claiming any step, service, adapter, CLI flag, or feature is completed, agents **MUST** inspect the underlying code to ensure it contains genuine, functional logic.
  - If any mock, stub, simulated return value, or placeholder exists, it must be clearly and transparently flagged in the agent's final answer.

---

## 4. OpenTelemetry & Observability Rules

- Respect SvelteKit version boundaries (>= 2.31.0 for native tracing).
- Inspect user project for `src/instrumentation.server.ts|js|mjs`. If present, preserve user file intact. If missing, fall back to virtual injection (`.pokkum/src/instrumentation.server.ts`).
- When `--with-otel-sidecar` is set, ensure the OpenTelemetry Collector sidecar spec (`4317` gRPC, `4318` HTTP, `8889` metrics) is correctly injected into Kubernetes Pod manifests.

---

## 5. Task Completion Verification Protocol

The verification protocol applies **ONLY when Go source code (`.go` files, build manifests, dependencies) has been created, modified, or refactored**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Do **NOT** run the verification test suite for simple user questions, code exploration, planning, or documentation updates (e.g. `docs/roadmap/*.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Lessons.md`, `.md` files, docstrings, or memory graph edits).
> - Tests should be executed **only before declaring completion of actual code modifications**.

When code changes have occurred, agents **MUST** execute the following 5-step verification suite before declaring completion (`make verify` runs all five in order):

1. **Formatting & Static Analysis**: `gofmt -s -w . && go vet ./...`
2. **golangci-lint**: `make lint` — `gofmt`/`go vet`/`go test` alone miss findings this catches (`errcheck`, `staticcheck`, ...); see `Lessons.md`'s "4-step verification suite does not run golangci-lint" entry.
   **Do not run a bare `golangci-lint` from PATH.** `.golangci.yml` is v2 schema, which a v1 binary cannot load, and any binary built with an older Go than `go.mod` targets refuses the config and exits non-zero *without linting anything* — the failure mode that left CI running zero tests for six consecutive runs. `make lint` invokes the pinned version through `go run`, so the linter is built with this module's toolchain. Confirm the output reports an issue count; a non-zero exit with no findings listed means it never linted.
3. **Adapter Unit Tests**: `go test ./internal/adapters/...`
4. **CLI Compilation Check**: `go build -o ./pokkum-test ./cmd/pokkum && rm -f ./pokkum-test`
5. **Full Internal Test Suite** (includes Architecture Purity Verification `internal/architecture_test.go`): `go test ./internal/...`

`make verify` also runs two guards beyond those five, both asserting a generated artifact still matches its source: `check-docs-freshness` and `check-schema-freshness`. Neither is a test and neither is optional — they fail on a hand-edit or a missed regeneration.

`supervisor/` (the `pokkum-init`/`pokkum-static` PID-1 binaries) shares the root `go.mod` but isn't covered by any of the five steps above. If a diff touches anything under `supervisor/`, also run `go build ./supervisor/... && go test ./supervisor/...`.

> [!WARNING]
> **The five steps do not cover `tests/integration/`, and CI does.** Steps 3 and 5 scope to `./internal/...`; CI runs `go test ./...` plus a real-build E2E job. So a green five-step run is a claim about the packages inside its scope, never that no golden fixture or E2E stub *elsewhere in the repo* depends on what changed. `tests/integration/` independently pins full OCI manifest/config/index JSON (`testdata/golden/*.json`) and carries its own stub `BaseImageResolver`s.
>
> **Run `GOTOOLCHAIN=go$(awk '/^go [0-9]/{print $2}' go.mod) go test -short ./...` before declaring any change complete that touches image labels/annotations, layer compression, tar construction, OCI manifest/config assembly, or any widely-depended-on primitive (hashing, serialization, a shared struct in `ports`).** It is one command and it is the difference between finding this locally and finding it in CI.
>
> This has now happened twice, which is why it is here rather than only in `mem:task_completion`: the rule was written after the 2026-08-17 gzip-swap incident and lived only in that memory, so an agent following §5's five steps in good faith walked into the identical trap on 2026-09-01 (a `base.name` change that two E2E stubs and one golden depended on). A verification rule that lives outside the section describing the verification suite is a rule with no matching read.

Before declaring any non-trivial feature or refactor complete, review your own diff (`git diff`) line by line against the functional spec. Use the Self-Review Checklist below to do this — treat it as a set of things to *mechanically verify* against the actual diff, not a paragraph to keep in mind while skimming.

If a bug or edge case failure is found during self-review, flag it explicitly, fix it, and re-run the full verification suite. **Silent patching is strictly forbidden.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every new guard must be shown to fail.** Nine separate `Lessons.md` entries are one class: a test or check that passed while verifying nothing — a fixture that fabricated the shape the buggy code assumed, a cache that returned the first build's bytes to the second, a linter that exited zero without linting, three of four race guards that passed with the fix reverted. A green run of a test you just wrote is not evidence until you have seen it go red.
>
> So: after writing a guard, **revert the fix (or break the input it protects), run it, and record the failure output in your final answer**; then restore and re-run. If it cannot be made to fail, the guard is measuring the wrong thing — fix the guard before trusting the fix. This is cheap, takes one command, and is the difference between a test and a decoration. `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 30, 43 and 45 cover specific instances; this is the general rule and it applies to every guard you add, not only to the ones those rows name.

### 5.1 Self-Review Checklist

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A real bug in this codebase (a goroutine leak in a fan-out resolve loop) survived an instruction that told the agent, in prose, to "scan for goroutine leaks." The instruction wasn't wrong, it just wasn't checkable — nothing forced a concrete look at the specific lines where it mattered.

The checklist itself lives in Serena as `mem:self_review_checklist`, not inline here. It's a cross-harness artifact — every agent working this codebase has Serena access, and an edited-in-place shared checklist beats several drifting local copies.

**Read `mem:self_review_checklist` before declaring any non-trivial diff complete, and run it in the two passes its own header describes:** an always-on core of 8 rows that apply to every Go diff, then only the rows whose trigger your diff actually matches (its trigger index maps "diff does X" → row numbers). A typical diff matches three to six. Run those against the actual diff lines, not from memory of having read them once. If a row doesn't apply, say so explicitly ("N/A: no concurrent dispatch in this diff") rather than skipping it silently — the explicit N/A is what proves the row was considered rather than skimmed.

The two-pass structure exists because the checklist reached 57 rows, and a table too long to run mechanically gets skimmed — which is the exact failure (a prose instruction that nothing forced a concrete look at) that created this checklist in the first place. When you add a row, add it to the trigger index too, or it will not be reached.

### 5.2 Commit Discipline

A change that only exists as uncommitted working-tree state is one `git clean`/`checkout`/`reset --hard` away from being lost, and it can't be reviewed, diffed, or handed off. Before ending a session that produced a non-trivial code change:

- Commit it, with a message describing *what* and *why* — not `"Commit"` or `"wip"`. If the change has logically separable phases (e.g. "add the port interface" vs. "wire it into the resolver" vs. "fix the bug found during self-review"), prefer several small commits over one large squashed one, so the reasoning stays recoverable later.
- If deliberately leaving something uncommitted (the user asked to hold off, or it's a draft), say so explicitly in the final answer. Don't let it go unmentioned.

### 5.3 Root Cause Analysis & `Lessons.md`

Upon discovering a bug during self-review or debugging:

1. Conduct a root-cause analysis into _why_ the bug was introduced (e.g., faulty assumption, missed boundary, leaky abstraction).
2. Log the incident in [`Lessons.md`](Lessons.md) (creating the file if it does not exist), using this structure so future agents can find and act on it, not just read it in passing:

   ```
   ## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary>
   **Category:** <e.g. concurrency / resource-leak / multi-item / determinism / boundary>
   **Root cause:** <the faulty assumption or missed case>
   **Where:** <file:line or function>
   **Fix:** <what changed>
   **Preventative rule:** <the general, reusable rule — this is what feeds `mem:self_review_checklist`>
   ```

3. **Close the loop — update `mem:self_review_checklist` in Serena, don't just log the incident.** Use Serena's `edit_memory`/`write_memory` tools to check whether the bug's category matches an existing row:
   - If it matches but the checklist didn't catch it, the row's wording was too vague or too narrow — revise it so this exact failure mode is unambiguously covered next time.
   - If it's a genuinely new category, add a new row.

   A `Lessons.md` entry with no corresponding checklist update is a bug likely to be reintroduced. The Serena checklist — not the log — is what actually gets consulted during the next self-review, by every harness working this codebase; an entry that never updates it is a write with no matching read.

## 6. Planning & Sub-Agent Orchestration Policy

This section governs **every** plan produced in Plan Mode (`Shift+Tab` / `/plan`) for a non-trivial task, and how execution is delegated once a plan is approved.

### 6.1 Plan document format

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tables over prose.** Every plan MUST include an **Execution Table** (6.2) as its primary structure. Use prose only for context that genuinely cannot be tabulated (e.g. the one hard constraint, a subtle correctness bug found during drafting). Bold the single most important constraint or risk in the plan so it is visually distinct from surrounding text — do not bury it in a paragraph.

Required sections, in order:

| Section            | Purpose                                             | Format                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Context            | What roadmap/issue this addresses, current behavior | Short prose + file:line refs               |
| Hard constraint(s) | Anything that must never regress                    | **Bolded**, isolated, one line each        |
| Execution Table    | The actual step-by-step delegation plan             | Table (see 6.2) — **required**             |
| Behavior changes   | Any user-visible change that isn't a defect         | Table: `#` \| Change \| Why intentional    |
| Tests              | New + must-update tests                             | Table: Test name \| File \| What it guards |
| Verification       | Commands to run, manual checks                      | Table or short checklist                   |

### 6.2 Execution Table (required in every plan)

This table is the single most important artifact in the plan — it is what lets you scan the whole plan in a few seconds instead of reading prose.

| #   | Step                                        | File(s)                                | Agent / Model | Depends on | Risk     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1   | Example: add stub method to mocks           | `pipeline_test.go`, `e2e_test.go`      | Haiku         | —          | Low      |
| 2   | Example: add interface method + field       | `ports/baseimage.go`                   | Sonnet        | —          | Low      |
| 3   | Example: security-sensitive resolver change | `resolver.go`                          | Opus          | #2         | **High** |
| 4   | Example: pipeline restructuring             | `pipeline.go`                          | Sonnet        | #2, #3     | Medium   |
| 5   | Example: new regression tests               | `resolver_test.go`, `pipeline_test.go` | Sonnet        | #3, #4     | Medium   |
| 6   | Example: adversarial full-diff review       | (all changed files)                    | Opus          | #1–#5      | High     |

### 6.3 Model selection rubric

Apply this table when assigning the "Agent / Model" column above — don't default to Sonnet for everything, and don't reach for Opus out of caution alone.

| Model      | Use for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Do NOT use for                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Haiku**  | Mechanical, low-risk, high-confidence work: adding a stub/mock method, renaming, boilerplate test scaffolding, doc/comment updates                                                                                                               | Anything touching security-sensitive code, concurrency, or files with recent hardening commits |
| **Sonnet** | Default for everything else: new features, most refactors, most test-writing, pipeline/control-flow changes                                                                                                                                      | Nothing specific — this is the default; escalate only when the rubric below says to            |
| **Opus**   | Only when it **measurably saves iterations**: security-sensitive files (recent CVE/hardening commits), subtle concurrency/cancellation correctness, final adversarial review of a multi-agent diff, or a bug already caught once at a lower tier | Routine work "just to be safe" — if Sonnet would get it right in one pass, Opus is waste       |

> [!NOTE]
> If a Haiku or Sonnet sub-agent's output gets corrected more than once for the same file in one plan, escalate that file's remaining work to the next tier up rather than re-prompting the same tier a third time.

### 6.4 `TodoWrite` discipline

Claude Code's built-in task list (`TodoWrite`) is the mechanism behind "Aufgaben aktualisiert" — it is not optional bookkeeping, it is the user-facing progress signal. Agents **MUST**:

- Create a `TodoWrite` entry for **every row of the Execution Table**, not a coarser summary — one entry per sub-agent dispatch, not one entry for "implementation."
- Keep each todo's content to a single short, concrete phrase (e.g. `resolver.go — VerifyBaseImage (Opus)`, not `work on the base image stuff`).
- Update status (`pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`) the moment it actually changes — not batched at the end of a phase.
- Never mark a todo `completed` until its verification step (Section 5) has actually run and passed for that piece.

### 6.5 ADHD-friendly status updates (user-facing)

After **every** `TodoWrite` status change or sub-agent completion, emit one short status line to the user — not a paragraph — using this shape:

```
[✅ done | 🔄 running | ⏳ waiting | ❌ failed] <step> (<agent>) → next: <step>
```

Examples:

- `✅ pipeline.go restructuring (Sonnet) → 🔄 resolver.go (Opus) running`
- `❌ resolver_test.go — digest mismatch test failing (Sonnet) → fixing before continuing`
- `⏳ waiting on test-writing agent (Sonnet) — next update on completion or ~25min`

Do not restate the full plan or Execution Table on every update — one line, referencing the step number from the Execution Table if useful, is sufficient. Save prose explanations for when something actually went wrong or a decision point needs input.

---

## 7. Keeping Documentation, Lessons & Project State Up-to-Date

Agents **MUST** keep the project documentation and persistent knowledge graph synchronized whenever code, CLI flags, interfaces, or architectural patterns change:

- **`Lessons.md`**: Record bug post-mortems, root causes, and preventative rules flagged during self-review or debugging sessions — and close the loop by updating `mem:self_review_checklist` per Section 5.3.
- **Roadmap / shipped log / feature list — `docs/roadmap/*.yaml` ONLY.** These four documents are **generated**: `docs/Roadmap.md`, `docs/Shipped.md`, `docs/Features.md`, and `docs/items/*.md`. **Never hand-edit them** — `make docs` overwrites them and deletes orphaned item pages, so an edit made there is silently discarded. Edit the item in `docs/roadmap/<area>.yaml`, then run `make docs`. `make check-docs-freshness` fails the build if generated output does not match its source, and the generator rejects an unknown field, a bad enum value, an `impl` path that does not exist on disk, or an `[title](item:<id>)` reference to an unknown id.
- **`schema/pokkum.schema.json` is generated too — never hand-edit it.** It is produced by `scripts/gen-schema` from `ports.ProjectConfig`/`ports.BuildProfile`, so a new config field belongs in the Go struct and nowhere else; run `make schema` after changing one. `make check-schema-freshness` fails the build on drift, and `make verify` runs it alongside the docs guard.
- **`docs/archive/`**: retired historical documents (the old hand-maintained `Roadmap.md`, `Feature-list.md`, `AdditionalFeatures.md`, `overnight-findings.md` and the v1-era logs). **Read-only** — cite them for provenance, never update them.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Update architectural diagrams, adapter contracts, layer layouts, and boundary descriptions.
- **`Vocabulary.md`**: Maintain the complete, human-readable reference of all CLI commands, subcommands, flags, defaults, and runtime environment variables.
- **Package-level `README.md` files** (e.g. `internal/adapters/<name>/README.md`): update alongside the top-level docs above whenever that package's behavior changes. These are human-facing, same as `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`Vocabulary.md` (Serena `mem:*` remains the source of truth for agents) — a new flag or field documented at the top level but not in its own package's README leaves a human contributor working in that directory with a stale picture.
- **Serena MCP Memories (`mem:*`)**: Keep the machine-readable project memory graph for agents (`mem:core`, `mem:conventions`, `mem:tech_stack`, `mem:telemetry`, `mem:task_completion`, `mem:self_review_checklist`, `mem:lessons_index`, etc.) updated with latest invariants and decisions. A new `Lessons.md` entry means three writes, not one: the entry itself, the matching `mem:self_review_checklist` row (§5.3), and a line in `mem:lessons_index` so the entry is findable by category rather than by guessed keyword.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Serena MCP is for Agents, docs are for humans.** Make sure to chose the most suitable wording, style, and tone for each document.

---

## 8. "Next Best Steps" Policy

After finishing any implementation task, milestone, or phase, agents **MUST** include a **"Next Best Steps"** section in their final answer.

- Base recommendations directly on the open items in [`docs/Roadmap.md`](docs/Roadmap.md) (generated from [`docs/roadmap/*.yaml`](docs/roadmap)).
- Highlight logical next features based on priority, developer experience impact, and architectural dependencies.
