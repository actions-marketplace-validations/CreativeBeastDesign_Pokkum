// Command pokkum-init is the PID 1 supervisor Pokkum places in every image it
// builds.
//
// It exists because a compiled SvelteKit server is not an init system. Run
// directly as PID 1 it inherits two responsibilities it was never written to
// handle: reaping every process the kernel reparents onto pid 1, and being the
// process a container runtime sends SIGTERM to. Getting either wrong shows up
// in production as zombie accumulation or as pods that take the full
// terminationGracePeriodSeconds to die on every rollout.
//
// Usage:
//
//	pokkum-init [flags] -- /app/server [args...]
//
// Everything after the bare "--" is the child command. See
// internal/ports/packager.go, which builds exactly this argv as the image
// entrypoint.

	// Because start() no longer performs exec.LookPath, the probe listener
	// binds and the child fork overlap instead of serializing: /healthz can be
	// answered as soon as the listener is up, while the Bun child is still
	// being forked/exec'd. That overlap is the "fast sub-millisecond supervisor
	// startup" the roadmap item names, guarded by the startup-overlap test.

	// The bind is deliberately ordered BEFORE verifyAttestation below. On a
	// real image the attestation hashes every byte of /app/node_modules and
	// /app/vendor — hundreds of milliseconds — and for that entire window the
	// probe port used to be connection-refused, which is indistinguishable
	// from a crashed container to anything looking at it. Binding first means
	// a probe gets a real HTTP status throughout. It changes nothing about
	// what is gated on attestation: /healthz still answers purely from the
	// supervisor's own child bookkeeping (503 until the child is running,
	// exactly as before), and BeginAttestation below holds /readyz at 503 for
	// the whole verification window so no load balancer can be told "ready"
