// guide.go implements `pokkum guide`: the operating manual for driving
// Pokkum from inside a SvelteKit project, printed by the binary itself.
//
// Why this lives in the binary rather than in a repository markdown file:
// the failure it exists to prevent is version skew. A Homebrew-installed
// 1.0.6 ships a README that does not mention `pokkum deploy` at all, while a
// newer binary earlier on the same PATH carries the whole Dokploy/SwiftWave
// surface — so a reader consulting this repository's docs for a binary they
// did not install is reading fiction. Text compiled into the binary cannot
// describe a different version than the one printing it.
//
// Audience: an operator or an AI agent working in a SvelteKit project that is
// NOT this repository. That audience is served by nothing else here —
// AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/DSH.md instruct agents working ON Pokkum, and
// Vocabulary.md is an exhaustive flag reference organised by flag rather than
// by decision, which that audience also cannot read because it lives here and
// not in their project. The guide therefore duplicates reference material
// deliberately; guide_test.go is what keeps the duplication honest.
//
// Anti-drift: this file is AUTHORED, not generated, following the same
// discipline Vocabulary.md already uses (flags_docs_test.go, envvar_docs_test.go)
// rather than the generation used for docs/roadmap. Three guards apply:
//
//  1. guide_test.go asserts every `yaml:` field of ports.ProjectConfig and
//     ports.BuildProfile is named in the config section, by reflection — so a
//     new config field cannot ship with the guide silently incomplete.
//  2. guide_test.go asserts every command in the cobra tree is named somewhere
//     in the guide.
//  3. flagmentions_test.go already AST-scans every string literal under
//     cmd/pokkum and internal, and fails on a `--flag` mention that is not a
//     real pokkum flag. Every flag named below is therefore checked to exist.

		Topic: "overview",
		Title: "What Pokkum is, operationally",
		Body: `
SvelteKit project in, OCI container image out. No Dockerfile. The build runs
the project's own SvelteKit build, then assembles the output into a minimal,
reproducible image and pushes it to a registry.

What enters the image:

  - the SvelteKit adapter's build output
  - production dependencies, when the strategy needs them
  - a pinned Bun runtime (strategy: layered) or the embedded static file
    server (strategy: static)
  - pokkum-init, a static PID 1 that reaps orphans, forwards SIGTERM and
    serves health probes

What does NOT enter the image: everything else in the project directory.
There is no implicit "copy the rest of the repo" step. If a file is not
adapter output, it is not in the image. This is the single most costly wrong
assumption when coming from a hand-written Dockerfile with COPY . — see the
"invariants" topic before writing application code that reads from disk.

The commands, in the order a project meets them:

  pokkum guide      this manual (pokkum guide topics for the section list)
  pokkum init       write .pokkum.yaml and .pokkumignore, after analysing the project
  pokkum doctor     preflight the environment and the project
  pokkum build      compile and publish the image
  pokkum dev        local run/watch loop
  pokkum config     inspect and validate .pokkum.yaml
  pokkum explain    inspect a real built image, layer by layer
  pokkum scan       CVE scan a project, image or tarball
  pokkum verify     rebuild and check signatures and attestations
  pokkum resolve    rewrite image refs in Kubernetes manifests
  pokkum apply      resolve, then hand the manifests to kubectl
  pokkum deploy     hand a pushed image to a PaaS control plane
  pokkum rollback   walk image refs in manifests back a generation
  pokkum adopt      migrate an existing project onto Pokkum defaults
  pokkum base       re-resolve and pin base images in pokkum.lock
  pokkum history    read a published image's own annotations
  pokkum repro      reproducibility diagnostics (pokkum repro doctor)
  pokkum upgrade    self-update this binary
  pokkum version    print version, commit and build date
`,
	},
	{
		Topic: "quickstart",
		Title: "The short path, from nothing to a running image",
		Body: `
Each step ends somewhere you can check, rather than at the next command.

  1. Confirm the project has a concrete SvelteKit adapter, not adapter-auto.
     adapter-auto produces no output Pokkum can package. pokkum doctor reports
     this, and pokkum build refuses with the exact remediation.

  2. pokkum doctor
     Cheap. Catches the missing adapter, missing .pokkumignore and absent
     registry credentials before anything expensive runs. Add --fix to repair
     the mechanical ones.

  3. pokkum init --defaults
     Analyses the project (see the "strategy" topic) and writes .pokkum.yaml
     with the detected strategy, runtime and base. --defaults skips the
     questions; the detection still runs. Drop --defaults for the interactive
     form.

  4. pokkum build --local
     Loads straight into the local Docker daemon. No registry, no deploy, no
     signing. Iterate here until it is green. Note that a daemon load drops
     OCI annotations — see the "output" topic — so this proves the image runs,
     not that it is publishable.

  5. Run it, as the real user:
       docker run -u 65532 -p 3000:3000 -e DATABASE_URL=... <image>
     Then check the app, plus the supervisor's endpoints on the probe port:
     /healthz and /readyz. Pass placeholder values for every name in
     image.require_env, or the supervisor will fail fast at boot by design.

     Use docker run, NOT docker exec. exec defaults to root, and root
     bypasses the read-only file modes via DAC_OVERRIDE — so a command that
     works under exec proves nothing about the non-root process that actually
     serves traffic. This has produced a false "it works" in practice.

  6. pokkum build --tag <sha>
     The real push. Add --sign in CI.

  7. Verify: pokkum explain <ref> for the layer breakdown, pokkum verify <ref>
     for a cryptographic verdict.
`,
	},
	{
		Topic: "invariants",
		Title: "Invariants that constrain your application code",
		Body: `
These hold in every Pokkum image and cannot be configured away. They shape how
the application must be written, so read them before writing code, not after a
build fails.

  1. Only the adapter's build output ships.
     Templates, fonts, seed data, migrations and anything else the app reads
     off disk are absent unless the project's own build places them inside the
     adapter output directory. A postbuild step that copies them there works
     today and is the supported pattern.

  2. The application tree is read-only. Mode 0555, every image, no opt-out.
     Any runtime write to a project-relative path fails. Writes must target the
     OS temporary directory, resolved from the environment at runtime — never
     a path computed relative to the working directory or the module location.
     This is a permanent property of how the layers are built, not a default.

  3. The process runs as a non-root user (UID 65532 on the default bases).
     Anything requiring root, a privileged port, or write access outside the
     temp directory will not work.

  4. Required environment is enforced at boot, not at first use.
     Every name in image.require_env must be present and non-empty or the
     supervisor exits before serving traffic. This is deliberate: a missing
     credential becomes a failed rollout instead of a 500 an hour later.

  5. The build never mutates your source tree.
     Adapter and telemetry injection happen under .pokkum/ in the project
     directory. Files you wrote are not rewritten. (pokkum adopt --write-config
     is the one explicit exception, and only when you ask for it.)

Before configuring anything, inventory what the app assumes about its
filesystem. Grep for process.cwd(), spawn(, and any path joined against a
project root; that list is exactly the set of assumptions items 1 and 2 will
break.

Written by pokkum init. Validate with pokkum config validate, resolve with
pokkum config view [--profile <name>]. Unknown or misspelled keys are
rejected, at the top level and inside every profile.

For machine validation or editor completion, pokkum config schema writes the
JSON Schema for this exact version to stdout:

  pokkum config schema > .pokkum.schema.json

It covers field names, types, enum values and unknown-key rejection. It does
NOT encode the cross-field rules -- the deploy target/method matrix, and the
runtime/strategy/base composition below -- so a config the schema accepts can
still be refused by pokkum config validate.

docker
  repo                  push target repository. Required for the default push
                        output mode; not required for --local or --tarball.
  tags                  tags without the repository prefix. Defaults to
                        [latest]. Overridden by --tag or POKKUM_DOCKER_TAGS.

image
  labels                extra OCI labels, merged with the auto-populated
                        org.opencontainers.image.* set.
  annotations           extra OCI annotations. Lost in non-registry output
                        modes — see the "output" topic.
  env                   environment variables baked into the image config.
  require_env           names that must be present and non-empty at boot, or
                        the supervisor refuses to start.
  ports                 exposed ports.
  port                  the application's listen port. Default 3000.
  probe_port            the supervisor's health-probe port. Default 8081.

  working_dir           container working directory.
  shutdown_timeout      grace period after SIGTERM before SIGKILL, e.g. 30s.
  origin                adapter-node ORIGIN.
  protocol_header       adapter-node PROTOCOL_HEADER.
  host_header           adapter-node HOST_HEADER.
  address_header        adapter-node ADDRESS_HEADER.
  xff_depth             adapter-node XFF_DEPTH.
  body_size_limit       adapter-node BODY_SIZE_LIMIT.

build
  exclude_routes             route paths (not file globs) to drop. A bare path
                             covers its subtree; "*" matches within a segment,
                             "**" across segments. Merged with --exclude-route
                             rather than replaced by it.
  allow_server_code_in_static  bool. Relax the static-strategy gate. Read the
                             "strategy" topic before setting this.

security
  fail_on_cve           low|medium|high|critical. Unset means warn-only.
  verify_base           bool. Verify the base image signature before use.
  allow_incomplete_scans  bool. Default false: an incomplete vulnerability
                        lookup blocks the build rather than passing quietly.
  allow_secret_patterns  glob allowlist for known secret-scanner false
                        positives.
  vex_exemptions        list of OpenVEX exemptions, each with:
                          cve, package, justification, status_notes,
                          expires, owner
                        expires and owner are required — an exemption without
                        an expiry and a name is not accepted.

sbom
  format                spdx-json (default), cyclonedx-json, or none.
  attach                referrer (default, OCI 1.1) or tag (legacy .sbom tag).

cache
  enabled               bool.
  verify_mode           auto (default), static-key, or keyless.
  pubkey                static verification key for cache entries.
  keyless_identity      expected Fulcio SAN for keyless cache verification.
  keyless_issuer        expected OIDC issuer for keyless cache verification.

otel
  sidecar               bool. Inject a collector sidecar into generated
                        Kubernetes manifests.
  tracing               bool.
  metrics               bool.

deploy
  target                dokploy or swiftwave. Empty disables deployment.
  method                api (default) or webhook. SwiftWave only.
  endpoint              the control plane URL.
  endpoint_env          name of an env var holding the endpoint instead.
  application           the platform's application identifier.
  token_env             name of the env var holding the API credential.
                        Defaults to POKKUM_DEPLOY_TOKEN.
  auto                  bool. Deploy automatically after a successful push.
  update_image          bool. Repoint the application at the new reference.
                        Defaults false; read the warning in the "deploy" topic
                        before enabling it, and rejected outright for swiftwave.
  registry_url          pull-credential registry, required when update_image
                        is true or stored credentials are cleared.
  registry_username_env name of the env var holding the registry username.
  registry_password_env name of the env var holding the registry password.
  timeout               request timeout, e.g. 60s.

  Only names of credentials appear here; the values live in the environment.

profiles
  A map of named partial overrides, activated with --profile <name>. Only set
  what should differ; anything omitted falls through to the top level. A
  profile may set output, platforms, base, strategy, runtime, stub_launcher,
  sourcemap, docker, image, build, security, sbom, cache, otel and deploy.

  Two fields are profile-only and have no top-level form:
    output              push (default), local, tarball, or oci-layout.
    sourcemap           bool. Keep source maps, for a debuggable local build.

  --local auto-selects a profile literally named "local" if one exists.
  pokkum config validate checks every profile independently, so a mistake
  confined to one profile is reported as that profile's error rather than
  silently ignored.

THE COMPOSITION RULE

  runtime, strategy and base are not three independent choices.

    runtime: node    requires strategy: layered AND a base that ships a Node
                     binary. pokkum init upgrades the base accordingly rather
                     than emitting a combination that validates and then
                     refuses to build.
    strategy: static ships no JavaScript runtime at all, so runtime is
                     meaningless beside it and is not written.

  pokkum config validate checks fields; this rule is a cross-field constraint
  enforced at build time. Write the three together or let pokkum init do it.

		Topic: "strategy",
		Title: "static vs layered, and what the analysis proves",
		Body: `
  layered (default)  an N-layer image with a pinned Bun runtime, running the
                     SvelteKit server. Works for every project.
  static             a zero-JavaScript, zero-runtime image of a fully
                     prerendered site, served by the embedded static file
                     server. Smaller and with far less attack surface, but only
                     possible if nothing in the project needs a server.

pokkum init runs a disqualifier scan over the route sources and reports
viable, blocked, or unknown. A project it could not scan is reported as
unknown — never as viable.

What rules static out. Each finding pokkum init reports carries one of these
kinds — the same identifier a JSON consumer of --output json can match on
instead of parsing the human-readable sentence next to it:

  kind                         condition                                effect
  body-dependent-handler       +server files exporting POST, PUT,
                                PATCH, DELETE or QUERY                  blocks
  page-and-server-coexist      a route directory holding both a
                                +page and a +server file                blocks
  form-actions                 export const actions (form actions)     blocks, always
  remote-server-helper         a *.remote file using query(), form()
                                or command()                            blocks
  unrecognized-remote-module   a *.remote file whose exports this
                                scan does not recognise                 blocks, fails closed
  prerender-false              export const prerender = false
                                anywhere                                blocks
  server-hooks                 hooks.server                            caveat only
  unreachable-dynamic-route    a dynamic route with no entries()
                                export                                  caveat only

Not findings at all — these prerender fine, and pokkum init reports nothing
for them:

  +server files exporting only GET/HEAD/OPTIONS
  a load function in +page.server or +layout.server
  a *.remote file using only prerender()

These are SvelteKit's own prerendering rules, read from its source rather than
inferred. Matching ignores comments and string literals, so a commented-out
directive does not count.

The list above is a summary. pokkum init's own output is authoritative for the
version you are running, and it names the specific file and finding — run it
rather than reasoning from this table if the two ever disagree.

The scan is a SOUND NEGATIVE ONLY. "Nothing found" means nothing in the source
requires a server; it does not mean a static build will succeed. A load
function calling a runtime-only API, or a dynamic route the crawler never
reaches, still fails later at build time.

Static also has two prerequisites beyond viability: @sveltejs/adapter-static in
package.json, and export const prerender = true in the routes root layout.
pokkum init reports which of the two is missing.

Set with base: in .pokkum.yaml or --base on the command line. The value is
either a preset name or a full image reference.

  distroless         the default. A small glibc base.

  distroless-node    carries a Node binary; required by runtime: node.
  custom             any full reference (registry/repo:tag or repo@sha256:...).

Presets are matched first. Only a value that looks like a reference — one
containing /, ., : or @ — is parsed as one, so a mistyped preset is rejected
with the valid list rather than becoming a registry lookup that fails much
later at pull time.

A custom reference defaults to static-key verification and FAILS CLOSED: set
POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY to the Cosign public key that signed it, or pass
--no-verify-base and understand what you have turned off. Each custom
reference gets its own pokkum.lock slot, so two custom bases in one project
do not evict each other.

pokkum base update to re-resolve and re-pin). You need this before building a
custom base that must be binary-compatible with a preset — the libc has to
match.

Resolved digests live in pokkum.lock. pokkum build re-verifies the locked
digest against the live signature at build time, including through a mirror.

Four targets. Pick by what runs the container.

KUBERNETES

  pokkum resolve -f k8s/ --recursive     rewrite image refs, print manifests
  pokkum apply   -f k8s/ --recursive     resolve, then hand to kubectl

  Image references are patched by CONTAINER NAME in your own manifests. Your
  manifests stay yours: sidecars, init containers, volumes and everything else
  survive untouched. Pokkum does not generate a pod spec.

  --probe-defaults, --resource-defaults, --security-context and
  --network-policy fill in hardened defaults; each has a matching opt-out form
  with a "no-" prefix, e.g. --no-probe-defaults.
  --with-otel-sidecar injects an OpenTelemetry Collector (4317 gRPC, 4318 HTTP,
  8889 metrics). That is the ONLY sidecar Pokkum can inject — see the "extras"
  topic if you need another.

  Roll back a generation with pokkum rollback -f <manifest>, which reads the
  image-history annotations Pokkum wrote.

DOKPLOY

  In .pokkum.yaml:

    deploy:
      target: dokploy
      endpoint: https://dokploy.example.com     # or endpoint_env
      application: <applicationId>
      token_env: DOKPLOY_TOKEN                  # default POKKUM_DEPLOY_TOKEN
      auto: true                                # deploy after a successful push
      update_image: false
      timeout: 60s

  update_image repoints the application at the newly pushed reference. It
  defaults to false for a real reason: the underlying Dokploy call is a FULL
  OVERWRITE whose schema requires all five registry fields, so enabling it
  without also setting registry_url, registry_username_env and
  registry_password_env CLEARS the pull credentials Dokploy had stored. Pokkum
  warns when it is about to do that. Set the three registry fields whenever
  update_image is true.

  A private image needs those credentials regardless; a public one removes the
  whole problem, which is worth choosing deliberately up front.

SWIFTWAVE

    deploy:
      target: swiftwave
      method: api                               # or webhook
      endpoint_env: SWIFTWAVE_ENDPOINT
      application: <applicationId>
      token_env: SWIFTWAVE_TOKEN

  Read this before designing the tag scheme: SwiftWave CANNOT be repointed at
  a new image reference. Both its webhook and its rebuild mutation rebuild the
  application's current deployment, so the application must be pinned to a
  MUTABLE TAG that Pokkum republishes. update_image is rejected outright for
  this target rather than silently ignored.

  For method: webhook the secret is already inside the URL, so no token is read.

VANILLA (anything that pulls from a registry)

  Pokkum's output is a plain OCI image, so any runtime that pulls one works
  with no deploy configuration at all. Build, push, and let the platform pull.
  The image already declares its port, its user, its required environment and
  its health probes, so most platforms need nothing else.

  What Pokkum will not do here is call an API it has no adapter for — leave
  deploy unset and drive the platform yourself.

WHICH IMAGE A BARE pokkum deploy SENDS

  None. .pokkum.yaml has no image-reference field at all, so there is nothing
  "recorded in configuration" to fall back to. With update_image off (the
  default) the call is a plain redeploy of whatever the platform is already
  pointed at, and the image reference goes unused. With update_image on,
  --image is required and the command fails naming the application without it.

  In practice you pass the reference the build just produced. A build with
  deploy.auto set to true does this for you inside the one invocation.

RESPONSE CLASSIFICATION

  Both PaaS targets answer HTTP 200 for outcomes that are not deployments, so
  Pokkum classifies the body rather than the status code and fails closed on
  anything it cannot positively identify as a started rollout.

  For Dokploy, an unrecognised 200 is then resolved rather than assumed: Pokkum
  reads back the application and looks for the deployment carrying this exact
  image reference. A rollout that started or finished is reported as the success
  it is; one the platform recorded as failed is reported with the platform's own
  error message; and anything it cannot positively observe still fails. So a
  Dokploy deploy reported as failed now means the rollout was not seen to start,
  not merely that the response body was unfamiliar.

  pokkum explain why <image> <path>

  before hand-rolling the same check with docker cp and docker exec.

EXTRA FILES FROM YOUR OWN PROJECT (templates, fonts, seed data)

  Supported pattern today: a postbuild step in the project's own build that
  copies the directories into the SvelteKit adapter's output directory, so
  they ride along in the layer that already ships that output. Then set
  image.working_dir to the path that layer mounts at, so the application's
  existing relative path resolution keeps working without code changes.

  Matching the container's working directory to the application's assumptions
  is much less invasive than rewriting the application's path logic.

  Confirm it worked with: pokkum explain why <image> <path>

AN EXTRA OS BINARY (Typst, pandoc, ffmpeg, ImageMagick)

  Pokkum builds SvelteKit images. It has no mechanism for vendoring an
  arbitrary third-party binary, and there is no flag or config key for it.
  Do not go looking for one.

  Two working approaches:

  1. A custom base image. Build a base that is the preset plus your binary:

       FROM <upstream tool image> AS tool
       FROM <the preset's resolved reference>
       COPY --from=tool /path/to/binary /usr/local/bin/

     Get the preset's real reference with pokkum base update — the libc must
     match. Use update, not check: check only compares an existing pokkum.lock
     against upstream, so on a project that has never built it reports no
     lockfile and produces no reference.

     Verify the upstream tag resolves for EVERY platform you build for before
     pinning it; a tag that exists for one architecture and not another fails
     late and confusingly.

     Unlike pokkum's own build, this step needs a running Docker daemon — and
     for a multi-platform base, an explicit docker-container buildx builder,
     because the default driver cannot build multi-arch at all. Wait for the
     daemon to actually answer rather than for its launcher to return.

     Then set base: to your reference, and either set POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY
     or accept that you have opted out of base verification.

  2. A separate image entirely, run alongside. Build the tool's image with
     whatever suits it, write your own Kubernetes manifest with both
     containers, and let pokkum resolve or pokkum apply patch the application
     container's reference by name. Your sidecar survives untouched.

     What Pokkum cannot do is GENERATE that sidecar — --with-otel-sidecar is
     the only injectable one.

  Also note the tool must not need to write into the application tree, which is
  read-only, and it runs as the same non-root user.

Each of these turns off a real check. Every one of them will make a failing
command exit 0. None of them is an answer to a failure whose cause you have
not yet identified.

  --no-verify-base
      Stops verifying that the base image is signed by whoever you said signs
      it. The usual reason this fails is a custom base with no
      POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY set. The fix is to set the key.

  --allow-incomplete
      Reports a vulnerability scan as successful even when the database lookup
      FAILED, i.e. when coverage was reduced and unknown. Default is
      fail-closed. Note --offline is different: it skips lookups by design,
      always reports incomplete, and still exits 0 — so gate on the reported
      incomplete field there, not on the exit code.

  --fail-on <lower severity>
      Raising the threshold to silence a finding is a policy decision, not a
      fix. Record it as a VEX exemption under security.vex_exemptions instead,
      which requires a justification, an owner and an expiry.

  --show-secret-values
      Prints the matched text of secret-scanner findings instead of redacting
      it. For local triage of a false positive only. Never in CI, where it
      copies real credentials into build logs.

  --no-inject
      Disables adapter/telemetry injection. The build then validates the
      project's real configuration and fails fast if it is wrong, rather than
      silently building something different.

  --allow-unverified-source
      Lets --expect-source compare against unsigned image annotations, which
      anyone able to push to the repository controls. The result is explicitly
      marked unverified.

  security.allow_incomplete_scans, security.verify_base: false
      The config-file forms of the first two. Same reasoning; additionally they
      apply to every build rather than to one invocation, which is worse.

The general rule: if you cannot say in one sentence what the flag stopped
checking and why that is acceptable here, it is not the right flag.

  "sveltekit adapter missing" / "adapter misconfigured"
      The adapter the project actually configures is not the one the chosen
      strategy needs — most often a fresh sv create scaffold still on
      @sveltejs/adapter-auto, which produces no output Pokkum can package.

      Check BOTH places the adapter can be configured: svelte.config.js, and
      the SvelteKit plugin's options in vite.config.ts. A current sv create
      scaffold ships no svelte.config.js at all and configures the adapter
      through the Vite config, so "there is no svelte.config.js" is not the
      same as "no adapter is configured".

      pokkum doctor reports this before you build, and the error names the
      exact package and the import to write. pokkum adopt can make the change.

      If the adapter is already concrete and the build output still never
      appears, stop suspecting Pokkum: check that the adapter and @sveltejs/kit
      are a compatible release pairing. Two independently-tagged prereleases
      are not guaranteed to work together, and an adapter calling a builder
      method its kit version does not yet expose fails by producing nothing —
      which from here looks identical to adapter-auto.

  ErrNotSvelteKit
      The directory is not a SvelteKit project. Check --dir.

  Base image verification failed / no key configured
      A custom base defaults to static-key verification and fails closed. Set
      POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY, or see the "escape-hatches" topic and decide
      deliberately.

  Static strategy rejected
      Something in the routes requires a server. Run pokkum init (or read the
      "strategy" topic) for the specific finding and its file. Form actions
      cannot be retired by any flag; export const prerender = false can be
      retired with a source edit.

  A config that validates and then refuses to build
      Almost always the runtime/strategy/base composition — see the end of the
      "config" topic. pokkum config validate checks fields, not the cross-field
      rule.

  Deploy reported as failed after a successful push
      Both PaaS adapters fail closed on any response they cannot positively
      identify as a started rollout. The image is already pushed. Confirm
      against the platform's own API before assuming the rollout did not
      happen, and re-run pokkum deploy --image <ref> rather than rebuilding.

  A file is missing at runtime
      See the "invariants" and "extras" topics; confirm with
      pokkum explain why <image> <path>.

  A write fails at runtime
      The application tree is read-only. Write to the OS temp directory.

Two unrelated sets. Do not mix them up.

THE CLI, on your machine

  0    succeeded.
  1    failed. This is the general path every command shares — a build error,
       a refused deploy, a red doctor, an invalid config, and also a usage
       error such as an unknown command or a bad flag value.
  2    pokkum verify only: verification COULD NOT BE PERFORMED. An unreadable
       trust root, unresolvable provenance, or signature material that could
       not be characterized.
  N    pokkum apply only: when the underlying kubectl apply fails, its own
       exit code is passed through verbatim rather than collapsed to 1.

  For pokkum verify the 1/2 split is the load-bearing part, and it is the
  reason to gate CI on the code rather than on "non-zero":

    1  the image was reachable and checkable, and it did NOT pass
    2  the check could not be run at all

  Treating those as the same thing means a broken verifier reads exactly like
  a tampered image. They are opposite problems.

  Because a usage error also exits 1, the status alone does not tell you that
  you typed the command wrong. Read the error output, or --output json's error
  code, when that distinction matters.

THE SUPERVISOR, inside a running container

  A completely separate set returned by pokkum-init as PID 1 — including 125
  for a startup attestation mismatch, 126 for a binary that exists but cannot
  be exec'd, 127 for one that is not found, and 128+N for a child killed by
  signal N. A crash-looping pod's exit status comes from that table, never
