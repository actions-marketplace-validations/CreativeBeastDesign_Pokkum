# Lessons Index — find the incident before you repeat it

`Lessons.md` is 100+ post-mortems and growing. `CLAUDE.md`'s Pre-Task Checklist
says to grep it for keywords, which only works when you guess the same word the
author used. This index routes by CATEGORY instead, so the question becomes
"what kind of change am I about to make?" rather than "what word might they
have written?".

Read `mem:self_review_checklist` for the rules distilled from these; read the
entry itself when you are about to touch the same area, because the narrative
carries the *why* that the checklist row compresses away.

## How to use

1. Find the category below that matches the change you are about to make.
2. Open `Lessons.md` and search for the date + title shown.
3. Read the entry's **Root cause** and **Preventative rule** BEFORE writing
   code, not after — a prior incident in the same area is a strong signal you
   are about to repeat it.

## The recurring classes, largest first


### silent no-op from picking the wrong near-identical function, or from a load-bearing fallback (1)

- `2026-09-09` — **boundary (serialization flag changed a verdict)** — `--output json` made failing commands exit 0 while text mode exited 1, so a CI gate passed on a red run. 13 sites across 6 commands, all `return jsonutils.WriteError(...)` (which returns the WRITE result, hence nil on success); one test actively defended the behaviour with a written rationale. Checklist rows 73 and 57.
- `2026-09-09` — A regex matching a string VALUE was run through `blankJSStringsAndComments`, which blanks string contents, making it unmatchable on every input forever and reporting the same "found nothing" a healthy project produces. In the same function, `filepath.Rel(absolute, relative)` errored on every call while its fallback silently did all the work. Read before choosing between two same-signature functions whose names differ by a qualifier, and before adding any fallback on an error path.

### encoding another tool's rules from a mental model instead of its source (1)

- `2026-09-09` — A classifier of "what SvelteKit cannot prerender" got two of four rules wrong (every `+server.*`; every server `load`) and missed a fifth, because the rules were inferred rather than read. The authoritative set is four `throw`s in `@sveltejs/kit`, one grep away. Exposed by running the classifier over the repo's own fixtures and finding it called `sveltekit-basic` unbuildable while `static_e2e_test.go` builds that exact fixture. Read before writing code that encodes what another tool accepts or rejects, and before putting a gate on top of any existing classifier.

### parsing user-authored source (comments/strings are not code) (3)

- `2026-09-09` — A commented-out `kit.files.routes` beat the real one in `bunexec.resolveRoutesDir`, the THIRD site in this repo fooled by a bare regex over JS/TS source — after the class had already been fixed twice and two working comment/string scanners already existed in `sveltekitutils`. Read before writing any `regexp`/`strings.Index` against a file a user wrote; the answer is `stripJSComments` (matcher needs string contents) or `blankJSStringsAndComments` (matching an identifier), never a new scanner. See also the two originals below (2026-08-16 `fallback:`, 2026-08-17 `sveltekit(`).
- `2026-08-17` — `TransformViteConfig` rewrote `sveltekit(` inside comments and string literals; fixed with real lexical scanners.
- `2026-08-16` — `StaticFallbackFilename`'s whole-file regex was flipped by `fallback: false` in a comment and by an unrelated `fallback: true`.

### guard passed with the fix reverted — wrong observable (2)

- `2026-09-09` — A `*bool` clone in `deepCopyProjectConfig` was guarded by asserting the merged VALUE was still true; the function starts `dst := *src`, so the value is right without the clone and deleting it left the guard green. Identity (`merged.X != base.X`) is the observable. For any fix whose effect is cloning/aliasing/defensive-copy, a value assertion cannot see it.
- `2026-09-09` — A symlink-containment guard asserted `Verdict != StaticViable` and passed with the `os.Root` fix reverted: `os.ReadFile` follows the escaping symlink, reads the outside file and returns `StaticBlocked`, which is also not `StaticViable`. Read before writing any assertion shaped `!= X` / `no error` / `not empty` against a value with a third state — enumerate the other states and ask which one the BUG produces.

### guard-scope (off-by-one-level) / permission-and-mode fixes (1)

- `2026-09-07` — A chmod-the-parents loop restored the write bit on every path segment BELOW the sync root and never on the root itself, so the one file the feature exists to replace (`/app/server/index.js`, which has no parent inside the scope) could never be written. Invisible against a `t.TempDir()` fixture, which is 0755; found only because the fixture reproduced the packager's 0555 including a pre-seeded stale file. Read before any fix that restores or relaxes a permission, mode, owner or quota along a path, and before writing a fixture for code that touches a production artifact with a non-default mode.

### library-semantics-assumption / silent-degradation (1)

- `2026-09-07` — `exec.ExitError.Stderr` is populated ONLY by `cmd.Output()`, and only while `cmd.Stderr` is nil. An error-enrichment helper copied from an `Output()` call site to one that assigns `cmd.Stderr` returned the error completely unenriched — an RBAC denial surfaced as `exit status 1` with `Error from server (Forbidden)` read into a buffer and discarded. Caught only because the test asserted on the error's *content*, not on `err != nil`. Read before reusing any error-enrichment or output-capture helper at a new subprocess call site.

### release-pipeline / unresumable-by-construction (1)

- `2026-09-06` — Pokkum's own release binaries embedded a wall-clock build date, so they were not reproducible, so a v1.1.0 release that published GitHub + Homebrew and then failed at npm could not be re-run: rebuilt bytes hit `422 already_exists`, and deleting the assets would have broken the formula's pinned sha256 and the SLSA attestation. Read before touching `.goreleaser.yaml` or any multi-destination publish.

### fixture-availability / verified-locally-only (1)

- `2026-09-06` — A new test asserted that gitignored build output under `testdata/fixtures/*/build` was "committed" and hard-failed when absent, breaking two CI jobs on the first clean checkout. The convention for exactly this (skip by default, hard-fail behind `POKKUM_REQUIRE_MINIFIED_CORPUS`) already existed in one test and was not reused. Read before writing any test that reads a path a build produces; the catching move is to hide the directory and re-run.

### shared-mutable-input in a fan-out (1)

- `2026-09-05` — Two platforms stripped and tarred the same directory concurrently. `striputils` had no lock at all while `precompressutils` had one, and even the lock would not have been enough: it orders writers against writers, never writers against readers. The fix is a build-scoped memo so the work happens once. Read before adding any step that mutates a shared directory in place inside the per-platform fan-out.

### self-invalidating cache key / unobservable-by-construction (1)

- `2026-09-05` — The remote build cache could never hit, on any project, since it shipped: `pokkum.lock` was hashed as project source, but the build stamps `time.Now()` into that file before computing the hash. Invisible because a cache that never hits looks exactly like one that correctly misses. Read before adding any path to a content-addressed key, and before shipping any optimisation whose failure mode is "silently does nothing".

### cache-completeness (1)

- `2026-09-05` — A credential cache stored only its successes, so the "no credential for this registry" answer — the most frequently requested one — re-spawned a 100-500ms helper subprocess on every call forever. Read before adding any memo: enumerate every return path, and assert the memo's benefit by counting the underlying operation, because a cache that stores nothing still returns correct values.

### prefilter-soundness / library-semantics-assumption (1)

- `2026-09-05` — A literal prefilter for a `(?i)` regex is unsound if it folds ASCII (Go's `(?i)` is Unicode simple folding; U+017F and U+212A really do match `secretguard`'s live rules), and the "fast literal alternation" it was meant to replace measured 26x SLOWER than the scan it gated. Read before adding any fast path, prefilter or short-circuit in front of an existing check, or before building on a stated performance property of a library.

### repeated-failure-class (1)

- `2026-09-05` — The `bufio.Scanner` token-limit bug was fixed once in `secretguard` and left untouched in `sveltekitutils`, where a strict wiring gates the build on it. A 102KB single-line minified bundle was reported as having zero dynamic imports. Root cause is not the scanner limit (already logged 2026-08-18) but that a post-mortem rule stated over a *class* was acted on for exactly one instance, with nothing enumerating the rest. Read this before writing any entry whose preventative rule generalises past the file the bug was found in.

### boundary (34)

- `2026-09-09` — `pokkum doctor` reported a fresh `sv create` scaffold (`@sveltejs/adapter-auto`, unconfigured) as a valid SvelteKit project while `pokkum build` refused it immediately after — doctor's only adapter-related check verified `@sveltejs/kit` was a dependency and never looked at which adapter was actually configured. The second occurrence of the 2026-09-01 `pokkum config validate`/`pokkum deploy` shape below; fixed by making doctor call the exact same decision function (`sveltekitutils.EffectiveAdapterConfigured`) the build preflight uses, plus a new `ports.BuildStrategy.RequiredAdapterPackage` to stop bunexec's own two internal copies of the strategy→adapter mapping from being able to drift from each other. Read before adding any diagnostic/preflight check whose whole job is predicting whether a separate command will succeed.
