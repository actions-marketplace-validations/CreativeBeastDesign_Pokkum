## 2026-09-09 — `--output json` made a red `pokkum doctor` exit 0, so a CI gate on it passed while doctor was failing

**Category:** boundary / serialization flag changed a verdict — an output-format switch silently altered whether the command reported success

**Root cause:** `runDoctor` (`cmd/pokkum/doctor.go`) shares one failure signal, `if !allPassed { return ... }`, at the very end of the function. The JSON branch sits earlier and returns as soon as it has written the envelope, so control never reaches that signal. Text mode exited 1 on a red doctor; JSON mode wrote `status:"error"`, `passed:false` and a list of failing checks — and then exited 0.

The envelope was never wrong. Every failing check, with its remediation, was right there in the payload. What was wrong was the process exit status, which is the only thing a `set -e` CI step or a `&&` chain actually reads. A machine consumer following the documented contract would treat a red doctor as green, and nothing anywhere would contradict it.

Two things made this survivable for as long as it was. The bug is invisible in text mode, which is what a human runs. And it was *introduced* by an early return added for a good local reason (write the envelope, return the write error), where the missing consideration was not "did I handle this error" but "does my early return skip a shared postlude".

It was found only because a concurrent task explicitly compared before/after exit codes in both modes and reported the discrepancy as a pre-existing quirk rather than assuming it was intended — and because a freshly written `Vocabulary.md` exit-code table had just claimed exit 1 covers "a red doctor", with no format caveat, making the contradiction concrete.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/doctor.go`, `runDoctor`'s JSON branch (`return err` after `Fprintln`), versus the `if !allPassed` at the end of the same function.

**Fix:** the JSON branch now returns `errDoctorChecksFailed` (a `silentExitError`, so `main.go`'s `isSilentExit` exits 1 without logging a second line that would contradict and corrupt the JSON on stdout). `cmd/pokkum/exitcodes_test.go`'s `TestDoctorExitStatusIsIndependentOfOutputFormat` drives `runDoctor` in both formats against the same fixture and requires their error-ness to match; it carries a premise check so a fixture that stopped failing cannot make it compare two nils and pass.

**Widened 2026-09-09, same day:** auditing every other `--output json` branch the way the rule below prescribes found the identical bug in `adopt`, `explain` and `history` (confirmed by running them: text exited 1, JSON exited 0 while printing `status:"error"`), and a scan for the shape found **thirteen** sites across six commands. `doctor` was not a one-off; it was the instance that happened to be looked at.

The shape is an API trap, which is why it replicated: `jsonutils.WriteError` returns the *write* result, so `return jsonutils.WriteError(...)` reads as "return this error" and returns `nil` the moment the envelope is written successfully — sitting directly above a text branch returning a real error on the same input. All thirteen now call `failJSON()`, which writes the same envelope and returns a silent failure.

Worse, one test *defended* the bug. `TestHistoryCommand_ImageNotFound` required the JSON path to return nil and justified it in a comment: "CI is expected to parse status, not rely on the exit code, in `--output=json` mode", citing `adopt.go/doctor.go/init.go` as the established convention. Those were the same bug replicated, not a precedent, and `set -e` reads the exit status and nothing else. A wrong assumption written down as a rationale is far more durable than an unexamined one, because the next reader takes it as settled.

**Preventative rule:** An output-format flag selects a **serialization**. It must never change whether the command succeeded, what it exits with, or which side effects ran. Whenever a format branch returns early, check what shared postlude it skips — a failure signal, a cleanup, an exit-status decision — because the branch reads as complete on its own and the skipped code is usually far away at the end of the function. Assert the invariant directly by running the same failing fixture through every supported format and comparing exit status, rather than testing each format's output in isolation, which is exactly how this passed review. And when you find one instance, **grep for the shape before assuming it is one** — this was thirteen. If a helper's name says "error" but its return value is a write result, the call sites will keep making the same mistake, so fix the helper's ergonomics rather than the call sites one at a time.

## 2026-09-09 — `pokkum doctor` passed a project `pokkum build` refused, because doctor never checked which adapter was actually configured

**Category:** boundary / validator-consumer disagreement — doctor's job is exactly to catch what build will refuse, and it had a gap wide enough to miss the single most common unbuildable starting state

**Root cause:** `checkSvelteKitWorkspace` in `cmd/pokkum/doctor.go` verified only that `@sveltejs/kit` appeared in `package.json`'s dependencies — it never looked at which adapter package `svelte.config.js`/`vite.config.*` actually configured. Meanwhile `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `checkEffectiveAdapter` (called from `Prepare`, just before `bun run build`) already refused a build whose effective adapter did not match the chosen strategy, with a good, specific message. A fresh `bunx sv create` scaffold — `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` only, configured via `vite.config.ts` options (current `sv create` ships no `svelte.config.js` at all) — is exactly this shape: it passed `doctor` cleanly and was refused by `build` immediately after, inverting doctor's whole contract (early warning vs. safety net).

A second, smaller instance of the same drift class lived inside `bunexec` itself: `Preflight` and `Prepare` each carried their own independent inline `switch req.Strategy { ... }` mapping a strategy to its required adapter package. The two copies happened to still agree (verified by diffing them — mem:self_review_checklist row 69(b) — before consolidating, since collapsing duplicates unread is how a diverged copy ships forward silently), but nothing forced them to stay in sync, and a third hand-written copy in `doctor` would have made three.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/doctor.go`'s `checkSvelteKitWorkspace`; `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Preflight` and `Prepare` (the duplicated `targetAdapter` switch); `internal/ports/compiler.go` (no shared mapping existed).

**Fix:** `ports.BuildStrategy.RequiredAdapterPackage()` is now the single source for the strategy → adapter package mapping; `Preflight` and `Prepare` both call it instead of restating the switch. A new `cmd/pokkum/doctor.go` check, `checkSvelteKitAdapter`, resolves the project's effective strategy from `.pokkum.yaml` (defaulting the same way `core.BuildRequest.Normalize()` does) and calls the same decision function `checkEffectiveAdapter` uses — `sveltekitutils.EffectiveAdapterConfigured` — never a second, independently-written comparison. `bunexec.ViteConfigCandidates` (formerly unexported `viteConfigNames`) is exported so doctor resolves "which Vite config file governs" in the exact same order `Prepare` does, instead of restating that list too. The check honestly reports "cannot determine" (not a clean pass or a confident failure) when a config file exists but cannot be read, or when `.pokkum.yaml`'s `strategy:` value is unparseable — guessing either verdict from missing information would be the same false confidence this check exists to remove.

**Preventative rule:** When a diagnostic command (`doctor`, `validate`, `check`) and the command whose failure it is supposed to predict (`build`, `deploy`, `apply`) both need to answer the same yes/no question about project state, that answer must come from one shared function, never two hand-written comparisons that happen to agree today. Before doctor's check existed, the only way to keep it in sync with build would have been discipline — remembering to update two places whenever the rule changed — which is exactly the failure mode this whole incident is about. See `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 11 and 69(b), and the 2026-09-01 "validator-consumer disagreement" entry (`pokkum config validate` / `pokkum deploy`) for the same shape in a different pair of commands.

## 2026-09-09 — Picking the wrong one of two near-identical scanners made a regex silently unmatchable, and a fallback hid a second bug the same way

**Category:** silent-degradation / near-miss-API — two bugs in one function, both of which fail by
quietly producing the "nothing found" answer

**Root cause:** `sveltekitutils` has two scanners that differ only in whether string literal
CONTENTS survive: `stripJSComments` (contents kept — needed to capture a value like
`fallback: '200.html'`) and `blankJSStringsAndComments` (contents blanked — needed so an identifier
match is not fooled by that text inside a string). Checklist row 69, written earlier the same
session, states exactly that distinction.

The new `handleUnseenRoutes` detector matches a string VALUE (`'warn'` / `'ignore'`) and was written
against `blankJSStringsAndComments`. That scanner replaces `'warn'` with `'    '`, so the regex could
never match anything, on any input, ever. Not a wrong answer for some configs — an unmatchable
pattern, exactly the `\bghp_...\b` shape in row 50.

The second bug is in the same function. The route directory was converted with
`filepath.Rel(routesDir, dir)` where `routesDir` is absolute and `dir` is a project-relative slash
path, so `Rel` errored on every call. It did not matter, because the error branch assigned
`rel = dir` and the check then ran `dynamicSegmentRe.MatchString(rel) || dynamicSegmentRe.MatchString(dir)`
— the fallback was doing 100% of the work while the primary path was dead. Both were written in the
same sitting and neither had a failing test yet.

**Why both are the same shape:** each fails by returning the reassuring answer. A pattern that never
matches reports "no opt-out configured" and "no dynamic routes", which is indistinguishable from a
project that genuinely has neither. Nothing errors, nothing logs, and a test written afterwards
against a passing implementation encodes the silence.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/staticviability.go`,
`projectOptedOutOfUnseenRouteErrors` and `addDynamicRouteCaveats`.

**Fix:** `stripJSComments` for the value match; the `Rel` call deleted in favour of matching the
project-relative path directly, since a dynamic segment anywhere in the route's own path is what
makes the route dynamic. `TestAnalyzeStaticViability_DynamicRoutes/handleUnseenRoutes_opt-out_suppresses_it`
fails when the blanking scanner is restored.

**Preventative rule:** when a package offers two functions whose names differ by a qualifier and
whose signatures are identical (`stripX` vs `blankX`, `mustX` vs `tryX`, `...Locked` vs unlocked),
picking the wrong one is a silent no-op rather than a compile error — so the choice needs a test
that fails for the wrong pick, written at the same time as the call. And when a conversion has a
fallback on its error path, check which branch actually executes for real input before trusting
either: a fallback that silently handles every case means the primary path is untested, and may be
dead.

## 2026-09-09 — A classifier's rules were inferred from the tool's behaviour instead of read from its source, and got two of four wrong

**Category:** external-contract / spec-by-assumption

**Root cause:** `AnalyzeStaticViability` decides which SvelteKit constructs cannot be prerendered.
Its first cut encoded four rules from a plausible mental model of SvelteKit — "a server endpoint
needs a server", "a server load runs per request" — rather than from `@sveltejs/kit`'s own source.
Two were wrong, both over-rejecting:

- Every `+server.*` was treated as blocking. `src/core/postbuild/analyse.js:185` rejects a
  `+server` file only for `BODY_DEPENDENT_METHODS` handlers (`src/constants.js:23` —
  POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, QUERY). A GET-only endpoint is prerendered to a static response.
- Every `+page.server.*`/`+layout.server.*` `load` was treated as blocking. SvelteKit raises no
  error for one at all: server loads run at build time, which is how a static site reads a CMS or
  the filesystem in the first place.

A fifth real rule was missing entirely — `analyse.js:102`, a route with both a `+page` and a
`+server` file — because a mental model produces the cases you think of, and nothing enumerates
the ones you do not.

The complete, authoritative set is four `throw`s in two files. It took one `grep` for
`"Cannot prerender"` in a fixture's own `node_modules` to obtain, and that grep was not run until
after the wrong rules had shipped.

**What made it visible:** running the classifier over the repo's own committed fixtures, which had
never been done — every test used purpose-written inputs. `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-basic` came
back `blocked`, and `tests/integration/static_e2e_test.go` builds that exact fixture with
`StrategyStatic`. The contradiction was the signal; the fixture is a real `sv create` project with
a read-only `/api/health` endpoint, which is as common a shape as SvelteKit has.

Severity was luck, not design. Shipped, the classifier only fed `pokkum init`'s recommendation, so
the cost was bad advice. The next commit turned those same findings into a hard `pokkum build`
refusal — at which point both false positives would have refused builds that succeed today, and
broken two E2E tests.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/staticviability.go`, `classifyServerRouteFile` (now
`classifyEndpoint` + `classifyServerLoadFile`).

**Fix:** rules re-derived from `@sveltejs/kit`'s source, each carrying the file:line it encodes;
the missing co-location rule added; `TestAnalyzeStaticViability_AgainstRealFixtures` now runs the
classifier over all four committed fixtures with the `sveltekit-basic` row documented as
load-bearing for the E2E suite.

**Preventative rule:** when code encodes another tool's rules — what a compiler rejects, what a
format allows, which inputs a service refuses — derive them from that tool's source or spec and
cite the location in a comment. A rule you can state but cannot point at is a guess. And before
building anything that ACTS on a classifier's output, run the classifier over the repo's real
fixtures and reconcile every disagreement with what the rest of the suite already does with those
same fixtures — a fixture another test builds successfully, classified as unbuildable, is a
contradiction the codebase is already holding the answer to.

## 2026-09-09 — Two guards in one session passed with their fix reverted, both by asserting a weaker property than the fix provides

**Category:** test-substance / wrong-observable (row 45 family, second and third instances)

**Root cause:** two separate guards, written after their fixes, green immediately, and green still
with the fix reverted — caught only by the mandatory revert step.

1. **Negative over a tri-state.** A symlink-containment guard asserted
   `Verdict != StaticViable`. With `os.Root` reverted to `os.ReadFile`, the symlink is followed,
   the file outside the project is read, and the verdict is `StaticBlocked` — also not
   `StaticViable`. Logged separately above.
2. **Value where the fix changes identity.** `deepCopyProjectConfig`'s clone of a `*bool` config
   field was guarded by asserting the merged config's VALUE was still `true`. But
   `deepCopyProjectConfig` opens with `dst := *src`, so the pointer is copied and the value is
   already correct without the clone. The clone's entire purpose is that base and merged do not
   SHARE the bool. Deleting it left the guard green; asserting
   `merged.X != base.X` (pointer identity) makes it fail.

Both are the same underlying error: the assertion was written against what the test author
expected to see, rather than derived from what the fix actually changes. In (1) the fix changes
which of three states is produced; in (2) it changes pointer identity while leaving the value
untouched. Neither is exotic, and both were written by someone who had read row 45 that same
session.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/staticviability_test.go`
(`TestAnalyzeStaticViability_SymlinkEscapingTheProjectIsNotSilentlyRead`);
`cmd/pokkum/staticgate_wiring_test.go` (`TestApplyProfile_CarriesAllowServerCodeInStatic`).

**Fix:** assert `Verdict == StaticUnknown`, and assert pointer inequality, respectively.

**Preventative rule:** before writing a guard, state in one sentence what the buggy code produces
and what the fixed code produces — then check the assertion can distinguish exactly those two.
Two shapes where it usually cannot: a negative assertion (`!= X`, `no error`, `not empty`) over a
value with three or more states, and a VALUE assertion for a fix whose effect is on IDENTITY
(cloning, aliasing, copy-on-write, interning). Reverting the fix remains the only way to find out;
this entry exists because two guards in one session survived being written by someone who intended
to do exactly that.

## 2026-09-09 — A commented-out `kit.files.routes` won over the real one, in the third instance of a class fixed twice already

**Category:** parsing (whole-file regex vs scoped match) / repeated-failure-class

**Root cause:** `bunexec`'s private `resolveRoutesDir` matched
`routes\s*:\s*["'`]([^"'`]+)["'`]` against the raw text of `svelte.config.js` and `vite.config.ts`.
A project with a commented-out `// files: { routes: 'src/old-routes' }` above its real
configuration got the commented path, because the regex has no idea what a comment is. The
consequence is not cosmetic: that path is what `stageRoutesMirror` builds the filtered routes
mirror from, so `--exclude-route` would have mirrored a directory that may not exist, silently
excluding nothing (`os.Stat` fails, "no routes directory found", skip) — the exclusion reported as
applied and the route's code still in the image.

The mechanism was already written down twice. `StaticFallbackFilename` was found fooled by
`fallback: false` in a comment (2026-08-16), and `TransformViteConfig` by `sveltekit(` in a comment
or string literal (2026-08-17). The second of those shipped a real fix — `findLiveSvelteKitCall`
and `findLiveAdapterProp`, proper comment/string state scanners in `injector.go` — and
`stripJSComments` landed in `project.go` for the first. So this repo already contained TWO working
implementations of "skip comments and string literals before matching JS", and a third site that
needed one used a bare regex anyway.

That is the same shape as the 2026-09-05 `bufio.Scanner` entry, and the reason is the same: a
preventative rule stated over a class was acted on for the instances that existed at the time, and
nothing enumerates new instances on the way in. Neither `gofmt`, `go vet`, `make lint` nor any test
distinguishes a regex over user source from a regex over a config value.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/route_mirror.go`'s `resolveRoutesDir` and its `routesFilesRe`
(both now deleted); consumed by `stageRoutesMirror`.

**Fix:** the resolution moved to `sveltekitutils.ResolveRoutesDir`, which strips comments before
matching, and `bunexec` delegates to it. Found while building the static-viability analyser, which
needed the identical answer — the duplicate was going to become a third copy, and consolidating it
surfaced the defect in the copy being retired. `stripJSComments` was generalised into
`stripJS(source, blankStringContents bool)` at the same time, adding
`blankJSStringsAndComments` for identifier-level matching, so the package now has one scanner
serving both needs rather than a fourth hand-rolled one.

**Preventative rule:** before writing any regex or `strings.Index` against the text of a
user-authored source file, grep the repo for an existing comment/string-aware scanner and use it.
This codebase has had one since 2026-08-16 and has now been bitten three times by code that did not
look. More generally: when consolidating two implementations of the same question, diff their
BEHAVIOUR before picking a winner — the duplicate being deleted is where the bug was, and deleting
it without reading it ships the bug forward under a new name.

---

## 2026-09-09 — A new symlink-containment guard passed with the fix reverted, because "not viable" and "could not check" both satisfied it

**Category:** test-substance / wrong-observable (row 45 family)

**Root cause:** the static-viability scan reads files through an `os.Root` scoped to the project, so
a route source that is really a symlink out of the project is refused rather than followed. The
guard written for that asserted `Verdict != StaticViable`. Reverting the `os.Root` conversion back
to `os.ReadFile(path)` left it GREEN.

`os.ReadFile` follows the symlink, reads the file outside the project, finds the `query()` inside
it and returns `StaticBlocked` — which is also not `StaticViable`. Two entirely different
behaviours, one of them the vulnerability the guard exists to prevent, both satisfying the
assertion. The verdict enum has three values and the assertion only partitioned it into two, so it
could not distinguish the outcomes that mattered.

Caught only by the mandatory revert-and-watch-it-fail step, which is the whole argument for that
step: the test was written after the fix, passed immediately, and read as coverage.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/staticviability_test.go`,
`TestAnalyzeStaticViability_SymlinkEscapingTheProjectIsNotSilentlyRead`.

**Fix:** assert `Verdict == StaticUnknown` — the state only the contained read produces. Reverting
the fix now fails with `Verdict = "blocked", want "unknown"`.

**Preventative rule:** for any assertion written as a negative (`!= X`, `not empty`, `no error`)
against a value with more than two states, enumerate the OTHER states and ask which of them the bug
would produce. If the bug produces a state the negative also accepts, the assertion is measuring
the wrong thing — assert the specific state the fix produces, positively. A negative assertion over
a tri-state is a two-thirds-empty test that looks full.

---

## 2026-09-07 — A permission fix that handled every directory except the one that mattered

**Category:** guard-scope (off-by-one-level) / fixture-fidelity

**Root cause:** `pokkum dev --cluster`'s in-pod extractor has to write into `/app/server`, which the
packager ships mode `0555` — no write bit for anyone, owner included. `mkdirAllIn` correctly restored
the owner write bit on every path segment it descended through, so `chunks/a.js` worked. But
`index.js` — the single most important file the whole loop exists to replace — sits *directly* in the
root, where `path.Dir(rel)` is `"."` and `mkdirAllIn` returns immediately having chmod'd nothing. The
root itself was never made writable, so the very first entry of every real sync would have failed on
the unlink with `permission denied`.

The reason this is worth an entry rather than a shrug is *why it would not have been caught*: the
obvious test fixture is a `t.TempDir()`, which is `0755`. Against that fixture the buggy code passes
every assertion. The bug only exists against the mode the packager actually writes, and the test only
found it because the fixture deliberately reproduced `0555` — including on a pre-seeded stale file —
rather than reproducing "a directory".

**Where:** `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-init/devsync.go`, `extractTar`/`mkdirAllIn`

**Fix:** `ensureWritablePath(root)` runs for each `--root` before its `os.Root` handle is opened,
alongside the existing per-segment `ensureWritable` below it.

**Preventative rule:** When a fix restores or relaxes a permission, a mode, an owner or a quota along
a path, enumerate the endpoints explicitly — the root, the leaf, and the segments between — and say
which one each line of the fix covers. A loop over "the parents of X" silently excludes X's own
container when X has no parent inside the scope. And when the production artifact has a non-default
mode/owner, the test fixture must reproduce *that*, not merely the shape: a `t.TempDir()` is `0755`
and will pass for code that cannot write a byte into a real image.

---

## 2026-09-07 — `exec.ExitError.Stderr` is empty whenever you set `cmd.Stderr`, so a reused error helper discarded every failure reason

**Category:** library-semantics-assumption / silent-degradation

**Root cause:** `cmd/pokkum/k8s.go`'s `describeKubectlErr` enriches an error with
`exec.ExitError.Stderr`, and it works there because its caller uses `cmd.Output()`. The `clusterdev`
adapter copied that shape for its `kubectl exec` call — but that call needs *both* streams (stdout
carries the extractor's summary), so it assigns `cmd.Stderr` to a buffer. os/exec populates
`ExitError.Stderr` **only** from `Output()`, and only when `cmd.Stderr` is nil; once you assign it,
the field is always empty.

The result: an RBAC denial — by far the most likely real-world failure of this command — surfaced as
`exit status 1`, with `Error from server (Forbidden): pods "web-aaa" is forbidden` read into a buffer
and then thrown away. The helper looked like it was enriching the error. It was returning it
unchanged.

The test that caught it asserted on the *content* of the error (`want it to mention "Forbidden"`),
not merely that an error occurred. An assertion of the latter kind would have passed throughout.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/clusterdev/syncer.go`, `Sync`

**Fix:** `describeCapturedErr(err, stderr string)` for the `cmd.Stderr`-assigned path, kept separate
from `describeExecErr` for the `Output()` path, with a doc comment on each saying which is which —
they cannot be merged, and merging them is precisely how this recurs.

**Preventative rule:** Before reusing an error-enrichment (or output-capture) helper against a
different subprocess call site, check that the call site still satisfies the helper's *implicit*
precondition about which streams os/exec owns. More generally: when a test asserts on a failure path,
assert on what the error *says*, not only that it is non-nil — a helper that silently stops enriching
is invisible to `if err == nil { t.Fatal }`.

## 2026-09-06 — Pokkum's own release binaries were not reproducible, so a half-finished release could not be resumed

**Category:** release-pipeline / unresumable-by-construction — and a premise failure: the one property
this project sells was the one property its own release pipeline did not have

**Root cause:** `.goreleaser.yaml` built release binaries with
`-X main.buildDate={{.Date}}`. GoReleaser's `.Date` is the wall clock at build time, not anything
derived from the commit, so two builds of the *same tag* produce different bytes. Verified rather
than inferred: two local builds eighteen seconds apart differed
(`2cc808b26c66c850…` vs `65305cd0533a5f8c…`). The archives had the same problem one level up — git
does not preserve mtimes, so `LICENSE` and `README.md` carried the runner's checkout time into the
tar headers.

On its own that is embarrassing for a tool whose entire premise is bit-for-bit reproducible images.
What made it *expensive* is that it removed the pipeline's ability to recover from a partial failure.

The v1.1.0 release published the GitHub release and updated the Homebrew tap, then failed at the npm
publish step on an expired token. The obvious repair — fix the token, re-run the failed job — could
not work, and could not be *made* to work by deleting the uploaded assets either:

- GoReleaser rebuilt the binaries and GitHub refused the uploads with
  `422 Validation Failed [Code:already_exists]`, so the re-run died before ever reaching npm. The new
  token was never exercised.
- Deleting the assets first would have been worse. The rebuilt bytes differ, so they would no longer
  match the `sha256` values already written into the Homebrew formula (`brew install` would fail on a
  checksum mismatch) nor the digests the already-generated SLSA provenance attests.

So the release was stuck in a state with no safe forward path for that tag: npm could not receive the
same artifacts everything else had already committed to.

**Where:** `.goreleaser.yaml`, `builds[].ldflags` and `archives[]`.

**Fix:** `{{.CommitDate}}` replaces `{{.Date}}`, plus `builds[].mod_timestamp` and
`archives[].builds_info.mtime` pinned to the commit. Every input to the artifact is now fixed by the
tag being built, so a re-run produces byte-identical bytes and re-uploading is idempotent in effect.
The config change was validated with `goreleaser check` against the same `~> v2` the release action
resolves — the first attempt used a plausible-looking `archives[].mtime` field that does not exist,
and `check` caught it.

**Preventative rule:** **a release pipeline that cannot be re-run is a release pipeline that will
strand you**, because the steps most likely to fail are the last ones (registry auth, npm tokens,
signing) and by then the earlier steps have already published. Make every artifact a pure function of
the tag — no wall clocks, no checkout mtimes — so a re-run is a no-op rather than a conflict, and
verify that by building the same tag twice and diffing. The general form: **if a pipeline publishes
to more than one destination, the artifacts must be reproducible, or the first destination's success
becomes a lock on every later destination's failure.** And note where the check actually happened —
the wrong field name was caught by running the tool's own validator, not by reading the docs.

## 2026-09-06 — A new test asserted that gitignored build output was "committed", and broke CI on the first clean checkout

**Category:** fixture-availability / verified-locally-only — a test that passes on every machine that
has built the fixtures and fails on every machine that has not, which is exactly the set difference
between a developer's laptop and a CI runner

**Root cause:** `TestScanDynamicImports_RealMinifiedBundleShape` walks
`testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node/build` to find a genuinely minified line to scan. Using
real bundler output rather than a hand-written fixture is the right instinct — a hand-written file
cannot produce the one-line-is-the-whole-file shape the bug was about. But the test treated an
absent corpus as a defect:

    walk real build corpus …/build: no such file or directory
    (this fixture is committed; a missing corpus is a defect, not an environment difference)

That parenthesis is simply false. The fixture's *source* is committed; its `build/` output is
gitignored (`testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node/.gitignore:9`). And the real-build E2E tests
never populate it, deliberately: `copyFixtureProject` copies each fixture into `t.TempDir()` and
builds there, precisely so a shared fixture directory is never written to by a test. So the corpus
cannot exist on a CI runner at any point, and the test failed both the main and E2E jobs on the first
push.

**This premise had already been wrong once, in writing, in the same repository.** `ci.yml` carries a
comment explaining that a `POKKUM_REQUIRE_MINIFIED_CORPUS=1` step was once added "on the assumption
the e2e tests populated those directories. They do not, and the gate correctly failed rather than
passing on a corpus of nothing." The convention that came out of that — skip by default, hard-fail
only where the fixtures are known to be built — was implemented in
`secretguard/minified_corpus_test.go` and nowhere else. A second test over the same trees was written
without it. That is the same shape as this file's 2026-09-05 `bufio.Scanner` entry: a rule stated
over a class, applied to one instance.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/dynamic_import_scan_test.go`, `realMinifiedChunk`.

**Fix:** the corpus lookup now follows the established convention exactly, reading the same
`POKKUM_REQUIRE_MINIFIED_CORPUS` variable: absent corpus skips with an explanatory message, and fails
hard only when that variable says the environment promised one. An empty-corpus case was added too,
since a present-but-empty directory would otherwise have produced a confusing floor failure. All
three states were verified rather than assumed — skip when absent, fail when absent-and-required,
and genuinely run (29,215-byte real minified line) when present.

**Preventative rule:** before a test reads anything under `testdata/`, run `git check-ignore` on the
exact path. If it is ignored, it is not a fixture, it is a local artifact — gate it behind the
project's existing require-env convention rather than inventing a new one or asserting it must exist.
More generally: **a test whose availability depends on prior local work must be run once in a state
that has not done that work.** Hiding the directory and re-running takes seconds and is the only way
to see what a clean checkout sees; "it passes locally" is a statement about a machine that has
already done the work, and CI is by definition the machine that has not.

## 2026-09-05 — Two platforms stripped and tarred the same directory at once; a per-directory lock deduplicates work but does not order it against a reader

**Category:** concurrency / determinism — a latent bit-for-bit reproducibility hazard in the
multi-platform fan-out, found while optimising rather than from a failure report

**Root cause:** `Packager.Build` runs once per platform, concurrently, and every platform is handed
the *same* host directories — `.pokkum/vendor`, the native addon directory, the client tree. Two of
the steps that operate on those directories mutate them **in place**: `striputils.StripDirectory`
forks `strip --strip-unneeded` and rewrites each ELF file, and precompression writes sidecars beside
each asset.

`precompressutils` had a per-directory mutex for exactly this reason. `striputils` had no
synchronisation at all — `grep "sync\." internal/adapters/striputils/` returned nothing. So platform
B could rewrite a file while platform A's tree walk had already recorded that file's size and was
mid-copy into the tar. The visible outcome is a size-mismatch error; the invisible one is worse, a
layer whose recorded attestation digest and tar bytes disagree, or two platforms' "identical" layers
differing.

**The subtler half, and the reason a mutex alone is not the fix.** A per-directory lock makes the two
strips *sequential*, which stops them corrupting each other — but it does not stop the second strip
from running *at all*, and the second strip still rewrites files while another platform's tar walk
may be reading them. Serialising writers against writers says nothing about writers against readers.
The property actually needed is that after the first platform finishes, **no further mutation
happens**, so every later reader sees a stable tree. That requires the work to be done once per
build, not merely one-at-a-time: a memo, not a mutex. The lock is still necessary — it is what makes
the memo's critical section safe — but on its own it would have looked like a fix while leaving the
reader race open.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/striputils/striputils.go` (no locking), and the two call sites in
`internal/adapters/packager/packager.go` that invoke it once per platform against a shared directory.

**Fix:** `striputils` gains the per-directory `sync.Map` mutex `precompressutils` already had, and the
packager gains a per-build memo so the strip runs exactly once regardless of platform count. Both
halves are guarded, and both guards were shown red: bypassing the memo reports `StripDirectory ran 3
times for 3 platforms, want 1` *and* `2 platform(s) began their tree walk while a strip was still
rewriting the tree`; deleting the lock reports `StripDirectory returned while the per-directory lock
was held`. The same per-build memo now also covers directory-tree layer construction, which was
independently rebuilding byte-identical layers once per platform.

**Preventative rule:** when concurrent workers share a mutable resource, ask two separate questions,
because one lock only answers the first: *can two writers corrupt each other* (a mutex fixes this),
and *can a writer still be running while a reader reads* (only doing the work once, or an explicit
happens-before, fixes this). Any step that mutates a directory in place inside a per-platform fan-out
needs the second answer. And the general form: **if N identical workers each transform a shared input
the same way, the transformation belongs before the fan-out or behind a build-scoped memo** — running
it N times is not merely wasted work, it is N-1 extra opportunities to race a reader.

## 2026-09-05 — Replacing a `map[string]any` decode with a typed struct silently widened what matched, because `encoding/json` compares struct tags case-insensitively

**Category:** library-semantics-assumption / narrowing-a-type-widens-behaviour — plus a measured
negative result worth keeping, since the optimisation this came from was slower than what it replaced

**Root cause:** `ParseBunLock` decodes a lockfile's package entries into `map[string]any` and then
type-asserts the values back out, which is allocation-heavy and looks like an obvious candidate for a
typed decode. Four typed variants were built. The fastest one changed behaviour.

`encoding/json` matches JSON object keys to struct field tags **case-insensitively**. An explicit map
lookup does not. So a lockfile whose dependency block is spelled `"dependenCies"` — a hand-edit, a
generator quirk, a merge artifact — is ignored by `map[string]any` plus `m["dependencies"]`, but
becomes a **real dependency edge** under a struct with `json:"dependencies"`. That edge feeds the
reachability graph, which moves a package from `ScopeUnknown` to `ScopeProduction`, which changes the
SBOM's package count and therefore its digest.

That is the same class as the 2026-08-22 lockfile-determinism incident: a parser change that alters
which packages are considered reachable, invisible in every ASCII-normal fixture. It was found by
`FuzzParseBunLock`, not by review, and not by the 16-shape differential corpus either — no
hand-written corpus contains a case-variant key, because nobody writes one on purpose.

**The other half is the reason nothing shipped.** Every faithful typed variant was *slower in wall
time* than the `map[string]any` code, despite allocating up to 3x less:

    map[string]any (current)                36,930 allocs   baseline
    [3]jsonRawValue + struct meta           12,605 allocs   ~equal
    json.RawMessage + struct meta           15,900 allocs   ~equal
    eager elems + map[string]map[string]…   19,878 allocs   +27% slower
    eager elems + map[string]any meta       29,270 allocs   +22% slower

Two structural reasons, both worth knowing before anyone tries this again: `map[string]any` is
`encoding/json`'s own fast path, building values directly rather than through reflection; and **any
custom `UnmarshalJSON` on the entry type makes the decoder hand over that entry's raw bytes and then
re-tokenise them**, so nearly the whole file is parsed twice. Trading allocations for tokenizer work
is a net loss here. The one time-neutral variant was disqualified anyway: it aliased the decoder's
buffer, violating `UnmarshalJSON`'s contract that retained bytes must be copied.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/scannerutils/scannerutils.go`, `ParseBunLock`.

**Fix:** none — the change was **reverted**, and the measurements are recorded in a doc comment on
`ParseBunLock` so the next agent does not repeat two hours of work to reach the same answer. The
case-variant lockfile is now a checked-in fuzz seed. What did ship from that session is elsewhere and
real: a lazily-allocating `stripJSONTrailingCommas` (zero allocations for strict JSON), a
digest-keyed memo on `ExtractImagePackages`, and a `contentIdentityUUID` rewrite (66% faster, 80%
fewer allocations, byte-identical output).

**Preventative rule:** **narrowing a type can widen behaviour.** Before replacing a hand-written
lookup with a decoder-driven one, enumerate the matching rules the decoder applies that your explicit
code did not — for `encoding/json` that is case-insensitive tag matching, plus its handling of
duplicate keys, embedded fields and `null`. Test with a key that differs only in case; it will not be
in your corpus otherwise. And separately: **record negative optimisation results in the code, not
only in a report.** An optimisation that was tried, measured and rejected is knowledge with a short
half-life — without a note at the call site, the next person sees the same `map[string]any`, has the
same idea, and pays the same cost to learn the same thing.

## 2026-09-05 — A concurrency guard passed under `-race` with a real data race present, because it warmed the object it was about to hammer

**Category:** test-substance / guard-measures-nothing — a specific, nameable instance of the general
"show the guard fail" rule, worth recording because the mechanism is invisible on reading

**Root cause:** a test asserting that `ignoreutils.Matcher` is safe for concurrent use computed its
table of expected verdicts **on the same `Matcher` instance** it then hammered from many goroutines.
Computing those expectations walked every path in the corpus sequentially, which populated the
matcher's lazily-built internal state completely. By the time the concurrent phase began there was
nothing left to write, so the deliberately-introduced unsynchronised memo was never exercised, and
the test passed cleanly under `-race` with a genuine data race sitting in the code.

The failure is not in the assertion, which was correct, nor in the concurrency, which was real. It is
that the setup phase silently converted a write-heavy workload into a read-only one. Nothing about
reading the test suggests that: warming a shared fixture before asserting on it is ordinary, careful
test-writing everywhere else.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/ignoreutils/matcher_differential_test.go`,
`TestMatcherConcurrentMatch`, found while optimising `Matcher.Match`.

**Fix:** expectations are now computed on a **separate** `Matcher` instance, leaving the one under
concurrent test cold. Re-verified by reinstating the unsynchronised memo, at which point the guard
reports `WARNING: DATA RACE` with both sides in `Matcher.Match`, as it always should have.

(The same session's optimisation ultimately declined to add any memo — after classification a rule
check is a few string comparisons, so a memo would buy little while turning a read-only value into
shared mutable state on the fan-out hot path. This test is what now enforces that decision against a
future edit.)

**Preventative rule:** a `-race` test proves nothing about code paths its own setup already executed.
When writing a concurrency guard, ask what state the assertion's *expected values* were derived from
— if they came from the object under test, the setup has warmed exactly the lazily-initialised state
the race lives in. Derive expectations from a separate instance, a pure function, or a hard-coded
table. And apply the general rule that catches this without needing to foresee it: introduce the race
you are guarding against, run the guard, and confirm it goes red. This one cost a minute to check and
would otherwise have shipped as a permanent false assurance.

## 2026-09-05 — The remote build cache could never hit, because the build stamped the wall clock into a file it then hashed as source

**Category:** self-invalidating cache key / unobservable-by-construction — a feature that was inert
since it shipped, where the broken behaviour and the correct behaviour produce identical output

**Root cause:** `ComputeSourceTreeHash` walked the project directory and hashed every file not under
an ignored *directory*. `IgnoredBuildDirs` lists only directory basenames, so `pokkum.lock` — a file
in the project root — was hashed as though it were source.

But `pokkum.lock` is not source; it is something the build itself writes, twice, before the hash is
taken. `lockfileutils.SaveLockfile` stamps `updatedAt = time.Now()`, and `RecordScanResult` stamps a
per-entry `lastScannedAt = time.Now()`. Both run during base-image resolution and CVE scanning, which
sit *ahead of* `ComputeInputHash` in `core.Build`. So the composite input hash covered a file the
current build had just rewritten with the current time, and two builds of byte-identical source
produced different hashes.

The result: `--cache` never hit. Not "hit less often" — never, on any project, since the feature
shipped. The documented promise of a sub-100ms verified cache hit was unreachable in principle.

**Why it went unnoticed for so long is the actual lesson.** A cache that never hits is behaviourally
indistinguishable from a cache that correctly misses. Every build still produced a correct image;
every test still passed; no error was logged; the only symptom was that builds took as long as they
had before the feature existed, which is exactly what you would expect from a cold cache. There was
no assertion anywhere that a *hit* is reachable, and there was no benchmark that would have shown the
promised fast path never engaging. The defect was invisible by construction, and it was found only
because a concurrency change forced someone to enumerate every reader and writer of `ProjectDir`
during the build window — the timestamp write showed up as a torn-read hazard first, and the
cache-invalidation consequence second.

Note the near-miss: the same enumeration also found that `SaveLockfile` uses `os.WriteFile`
(truncate-then-write, no temp+rename), so once the secret scan and the tree hash were made
concurrent with it, a torn read would have produced a *nondeterministic*
`pokkum.dev/build-input-hash` annotation — a wall-clock artifact baked into content-addressed image
bytes. That was fixed in the same change by moving the write onto the build's own goroutine.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/remotecacheutils/remotecacheutils.go`, `ComputeSourceTreeHash`'s walk
callback; the writes are in `internal/adapters/lockfileutils/lockfile.go` (`SaveLockfile`) and
`core.Build`'s `RecordScanResult` call.

**Fix:** a new `IgnoredBuildFiles` set excludes `pokkum.lock` from the tree hash. Nothing is lost by
excluding it, because the lockfile's only build-relevant content is already a first-class, explicit
cache input — the resolved base digest travels in `InputParams.BaseImageDigest`. Everything else in
the file is metadata or pinned digests for base slots this build did not resolve, none of which can
change the image bytes. A user hand-editing the lockfile to pin a different base still invalidates
correctly, through that explicit field. Two regression tests guard it, and both were shown red
against the pre-fix walk; the first carries an explicit floor asserting that editing a real source
file *does* still change the hash, so it cannot pass by the hash ignoring everything.

**Preventative rule:** never hash a file the build itself writes. Before adding any path to a
content-addressed key, ask who writes it and when — if the answer is "this build, earlier", the key
is self-invalidating. More generally, and this is the half that would have caught it years earlier:
**a cache needs a test that a hit is reachable, not only that a miss is correct.** Assert that two
runs over unchanged input produce the same key, and count hits rather than trusting that correct
output implies a working cache. Any optimisation whose failure mode is "silently does nothing" —
caches, memos, fast paths, skip conditions — must ship with an assertion that observes the
optimisation engaging, because correctness tests cannot distinguish a disabled optimisation from a
working one. This is checklist row 62's counting rule, arrived at independently on the same day from
the opposite direction.

## 2026-09-05 — A credential cache that stored only its successes re-spawned the helper subprocess forever for the one answer that repeats most

**Category:** cache-completeness — a memo that caches the positive result and silently drops the
negative one, so the cheapest-to-recompute case is cached and the most common case is not

**Root cause:** `CustomConfigFileKeychain.Resolve` memoised a resolved `authn.Authenticator` per
registry, but only on the paths that found a credential. When a registry had no stored credential it
returned `authn.Anonymous` **without writing it into the cache**. So on any machine with a
`credsStore` configured (`desktop`, `ecr-login`, `gcloud`), every registry the user has no credential
for re-ran the credential-helper subprocess on every single call, for the life of the process — at
100-500 ms per exec.

The shape is worth naming because it looks harmless in review: the cache is clearly correct, in that
it never returns a wrong credential, and the missing write is on the branch that "has nothing to
store". But "no credential for this registry" is an answer, and it is the answer most likely to be
asked for repeatedly — a build touching a public base image registry asks it once per registry
operation. Caching only the interesting branch inverts the cost: the expensive-to-obtain answer is
kept, the free-looking one is recomputed forever, and the recomputation is a process spawn.

It was invisible because nothing measured helper invocations. Correctness tests pass either way, and
the cost only appears on a developer machine with a helper configured — never in CI, which uses
static credentials or none.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registryutils/keychain.go`, `CustomConfigFileKeychain.Resolve`. A
second instance of the same class sat one level up: `ResolveKeychain` re-opened and re-parsed the
config file and constructed a **brand-new** keychain (with an empty cache) on every call, so the
per-registry cache never survived a single registry operation regardless.

**Fix:** `Resolve` now caches the `Anonymous` result alongside the credentialed ones, and
`ResolveKeychain` is memoised per config-file identity so the per-registry cache accumulates across
the build. Both are covered by tests that count credential-helper executions rather than asserting
on returned values — 20 resolutions of one registry now cost exactly 1 exec, and 9 interleaved
resolutions across 3 registries cost 3. A guard also proves the memo never hands one registry's
credential to another, which is the failure a coarser key would introduce.

**Preventative rule:** when adding a memo, enumerate **every** return path of the function being
memoised and confirm each one writes to the cache — a `return defaultValue` or `return zero, nil`
that skips the store is the easiest one to miss, and it is usually the hottest path. State the
cache's hit rate as a testable claim: assert on the number of times the *expensive underlying
operation* ran (exec count, request count, file reads), not on the values returned, because a cache
that never stores anything returns perfectly correct values. That assertion is also what makes the
memo's benefit visible at all — this defect survived because nothing counted the subprocesses.

## 2026-09-05 — A literal prefilter for a `(?i)` regex is unsound if it folds ASCII, and the "fast literal alternation" it was meant to replace was 26x slower than the scan it gated

**Category:** prefilter-soundness / library-semantics-assumption — caught during optimisation, before
shipping, by testing two assumptions that both turned out to be false

**Root cause:** two independent wrong beliefs about `regexp`, either of which would have shipped a
defect.

The first was mine-by-instruction: the optimisation plan asserted that Go compiles a pure literal
alternation like `(?i)password|secret|token|api_?key` into a fast literal matcher, and proposed using
one as a cheap gate in front of `secretguard`'s expensive generic rule. It does not.
`Regexp.LiteralPrefix()` is empty for an alternation, so the NFA walks every byte: measured at
**12.6 MB/s** over a 4 MB bundle, i.e. 334 ms — on its own more than a third of the entire original
scan budget it was supposed to save. A "cheap prefilter" that is slower than the thing it guards is
worse than no prefilter, and nothing about the idea's plausibility would have revealed that. It was
found only because the optimisation was measured rather than reasoned about.

The second is the dangerous one. Go's `(?i)` is **Unicode simple case folding**, not ASCII folding.
An ASCII-only `bytes.Contains` prefilter for a `(?i)` rule is therefore *not* a necessary condition:
brute-forcing `unicode.SimpleFold` across the code point space shows exactly two non-ASCII runes that
fold onto letters in these keywords — U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S onto `s`, and U+212A KELVIN
SIGN onto `k`. These are not theoretical. Verified against the live rules: `xſecret: "abcdefgh12345"`,
`toKen: "abcdefgh12345"` and `paſſword="abcdefgh12345"` all match `defaultSecretRules`' generic
pattern today. A naive ASCII fold drops the rule for exactly those files, which is a silently missed
secret — the worst possible failure for this package, and invisible to any test corpus written in
ASCII, which is every corpus anyone writes by hand.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/secretguard/guard.go` — `activeRules`, `containsAnyFold`, and the
`RequiredAny`/`RequiredAnyFold` fields on the rule table.

**Fix:** the alternation gate was replaced with a windowed ASCII case-fold plus `bytes.Contains`
(~330 MB/s, no per-file allocation, early exit on first hit). Fold-aware prefilters use
`foldEscapeSequences`, which covers the two non-ASCII foldings. Crucially,
`TestPrefilter_FoldEscapesAreComplete` **re-derives** that set from Go's own `unicode.SimpleFold`
tables rather than trusting the hand-written list, so it fails if the Unicode tables ever grow
another one. `TestPrefilter_CaseSensitivityMatchesLiteralKind` derives each rule's fold flag from its
`regexp/syntax` parse tree, so a `(?i)` rule can never be given byte-exact literals. Soundness is
additionally checked by a differential corpus against the pre-change loop kept verbatim as an oracle,
and by three fuzz targets including one asserting the necessary-condition property directly
(pattern matches ⟹ the rule was kept).

**Preventative rule:** a literal prefilter is only sound if its notion of equality is **the matcher's
own**, not an approximation of it — for a `(?i)` Go regex that means Unicode simple folding, and the
test that proves it must *derive* the fold set from the standard library rather than assert a
hand-written list, because the hand-written list is exactly the thing that will be wrong. More
generally: when a plan asserts a performance property of a library ("the engine fast-paths this
shape"), measure it before building on it. Both halves of this entry are the same mistake in
different clothes — treating a confident claim about someone else's library as a fact rather than as
the cheapest possible experiment.

## 2026-09-05 — The `bufio.Scanner` token-limit bug was fixed once in `secretguard` and left untouched in `sveltekitutils`, where a strict wiring gates the build on it

**Category:** repeated-failure-class / resource-limit-vs-realistic-input — the same defect as the
2026-08-18 `secretguard` entry, in a second file, found by reading that entry rather than by anything
that checks for it

**Root cause:** `CheckDynamicImports` read each candidate `.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.ts` file through a
`bufio.Scanner`, whose default token buffer is 64KiB, and never checked `scanner.Err()`. A minified
bundle emits a single line far longer than that — a bundler's whole purpose is fewer, longer lines —
so `Scan()` returned false with `bufio.ErrTooLong` on the first call, the loop body never ran, and
the file was reported as containing no dynamic imports at all. Run standalone against a 102,454-byte
single-line fixture containing `import('./routes/'+routeName)`, the old loop reports
`lines scanned=0  computed imports found=0  scanner.Err()=bufio.Scanner: token too long`.

That mechanism is not the lesson; it was already written down. The 2026-08-18 entry describes this
exact failure in `secretguard`, and its preventative rule is stated over a *class* — "any
text-scanning code bounded by a fixed token/line/buffer-size constant" — not over the one file it was
found in. What acted on that rule, though, was a single fix to `guard.go`. Nothing enumerated the
repo's other `bufio.Scanner` users at the time, and nothing checks a new one on the way in, so a
class-level rule ended up protecting exactly one instance of the class. The second instance sat
untouched for two and a half weeks in a package whose entire job is to decide whether a bundle is
compilable.

Two things kept it invisible. `ClosuredNativeAdapter` — the adapter the shipped pipeline wires in —
discards this verdict entirely (`internal/core/pipeline.go` calls `Inspect` for its error only), so
under the default wiring the check is inert. `StrictNativeAdapter` does gate the build on
`HasUnsupportedDynamicImports`, and under that wiring the check silently passed exactly the minified
bundles it exists to reject. "Currently inert" is a property of the wiring, not of the defect, and it
changes without anyone touching the defective code — the `secretguard` bug was likewise inert until
the scan was pointed at build output.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/dynamic_import.go`, the `scanFile` closure inside
`CheckDynamicImports`; consumed by `internal/adapters/nativeinspect/strict.go` (`Inspect`, the
`HasUnsupportedDynamicImports` gate).

**Fix:** scanning no longer uses `bufio.Scanner`. `ScanDynamicImports` reads each file whole up to a
caller-supplied ceiling (`DefaultMaxDynamicImportScanBytes`, 16MiB — deliberately the same value as
`secretguard`'s `defaultMaxFileSizeBytes`, since the two walk the same trees and a quieter ceiling in
one of them is a coverage gap nobody stated), sniffs 512 bytes for NULs so a mislabeled binary stays
cheap, and splits with `bytes.Split`. A file that cannot be inspected — over the ceiling, or failing
after a clean open — is recorded in the new `DynamicImportCheckResult.SkippedFiles` and reported in
`Reasons`, and `StrictNativeAdapter` now fails preflight on a non-empty skip list: "I could not look
at this file" is a distinct outcome from "I looked and found nothing," which is the same distinction
`core.ErrSecretScanIncomplete` draws for `secretguard`. The sibling one-match-per-line bug from that
same post-mortem was present here too — dedupe keyed on `file:line` alone, so a minified bundle,
whose one line is the whole file, could report at most one finding however many it had — and is fixed
by keying on location *and* expression. Guards for the >64KiB line, the reported skip, and the
per-line multiplicity were each shown failing against the pre-fix code before being trusted.

**Sweep (done this session, so the rule below is one this entry actually followed):**
`grep -rn 'bufio.NewScanner' --include='*.go'` returns six production call sites. Five check
`scanner.Err()` (`scannerutils.ParseOSRelease`, `ParseDPKGStatus`, `ParseAPKInstalled`,
`ignoreutils.Load`, `scripts/gen-docs/findings.go`), and three of those also raise the token buffer
to 1MiB rather than relying on the 64KiB default. The one remaining unchecked scanner is
`cmd/pokkum/init.go`'s interactive prompt reader, where the input is a human typing at a terminal and
a truncated read has no "reported clean" semantics to corrupt — noted as a deliberate exemption, not
an oversight. `dynamic_import.go` was the last instance of the class with the silent-false-negative
shape.

**Preventative rule:** a preventative rule that names a *class* of code is enforced only if something
enumerates the class. When a post-mortem's rule generalises past the file the bug was found in, sweep
the repo for the rest of the class **in the same session** — `grep -rn 'bufio.NewScanner'` costs
seconds — and either fix each hit or record in the entry why it is exempt; a rule with one fixed
instance and no sweep is a rule that will be rediscovered rather than applied. Corollary, and the
reason this one survived: **do not defer a defect because its current caller discards the result.**
Inertness is a property of the wiring, which changes independently of the defective code, and a
silent false negative in a build gate is precisely the bug nobody notices when the wiring changes.

## 2026-09-01 — CI caught what the five-step suite structurally cannot, on the exact class a 2026-08-17 entry had already written a rule for

**Category:** verification-scope — a rule that existed, was correct, and lived where nobody following the documented protocol would read it

**Root cause:** the `base.name` fix changed a value baked into every image config. `CLAUDE.md` §5's
five-step suite scopes steps 3 and 5 to `./internal/...`, so a full, green five-step run — reported
as "46 packages passing" — said nothing about `tests/integration/`, which independently carries stub
`BaseImageResolver`s and pins full OCI manifest/config/index JSON. CI runs `go test ./...` and a
real-build E2E job, and failed on both.

The rule that would have prevented this already existed. The 2026-08-17 entry ("`make verify`'s
5-step suite doesn't cover `tests/integration/`'s own golden fixtures") ends with exactly it: any
change touching OCI manifest/config assembly must also run `go test ./...`. It was written into
`mem:task_completion` and nowhere else. `CLAUDE.md` §1 lists that memory as one to read "as needed
for the task", and §5 — the section that enumerates the verification suite step by step — did not
mention it. So an agent reading §5 and executing all five steps faithfully hits the identical trap
the entry was written to close.

The two stubs also failed on **fixture fidelity** (row 12) in a way that had been invisible while the
production code read `Ref`: neither set `UpstreamRef`, which the real resolver always populates
(`upstreamRef := ref`), and both fabricated a `PinnedRef` of the shape `repo:tag@sha256:…` that
`pinnedRef()` cannot produce, since it builds from `parsedRef.Context().Name()` and thereby strips
the tag. The unfaithful stubs sent the new label down a fallback path production never takes.

Corroborating detail worth keeping: `testdata/golden/*.json` pinned `base.name` to the **tag**, which
is what the fix produces. The goldens encoded the intended value all along and needed no
regeneration — the disagreement was entirely between the stubs and reality.

**Where:** `CLAUDE.md` §5; `tests/integration/e2e_test.go` and `static_e2e_test.go`
(`mockBaseResolver.Resolve`).

**Fix:** both stubs now set `UpstreamRef` and a correctly-shaped `PinnedRef`, with a comment naming
the production code they mirror. The verification-scope rule is promoted out of
`mem:task_completion` into `CLAUDE.md` §5 as an admonition adjacent to the five steps, with the
exact command to run and the list of change categories that trigger it.

**Preventative rule:** a verification rule must live in the section that describes the verification
protocol, not only in a memory that section does not require reading. Ask of any process rule: *what
would an agent following the documented steps literally, and nothing else, actually do?* If the rule
is not on that path, it will be missed by exactly the diligent agent it was written for — twice now.
Corollary for scope: "N packages passing" is a claim bounded by the package list you passed, so state
the scope when reporting it, and before declaring done on a change to a widely-depended-on primitive,
run the repo-wide suite once rather than trusting the fast inner loop.

## 2026-09-01 — A `head -10` on a reachability grep produced a confident, wrong recommendation to delete live code

**Category:** process / truncated-evidence — a completeness question answered with a deliberately incomplete command

**Root cause:** deciding whether `TransformConfig` was dead is a question of the form "does ANY caller
exist?", which is answered only by a complete result set. The check run was
`grep -rn "TransformConfig(" --include="*.go" . | grep -v "TransformViteConfig" | head -10`. It
returned exactly ten lines — eight test files and two declarations — and the eleventh, cut off by
`head`, was `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/adopt.go:171`, the live production caller.

`head` is habitual for keeping tool output small, and harmless for "show me an example of X". It is
actively wrong for "is there any X", because it converts a negative result into an unfalsifiable one:
a truncated listing that happens to contain no counter-example is indistinguishable from a listing
that has none.

The consequence was not a crash — the compiler refused the deletion immediately — but a *confidently
stated wrong recommendation*: the user was told, with reasoning about parallel-path drift, that the
entire `svelte.config.js` transform path was dead and should be removed, and two documents
(`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `mem:state`) were updated to record that false claim before it was caught. Acting
on it would have deleted `pokkum adopt --write-config`'s implementation.

The confusion had a real basis worth recording: `pokkum build` genuinely stopped using
`TransformConfig`, having moved to the Vite path. The remaining caller is a *different command* with
the opposite mandate — `build` must never mutate user files, while `adopt` exists precisely to mutate
them. "No longer used by the path I was looking at" is not "unused".

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/injector.go` (`TransformConfig` and its helper chain),
caller at `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/adopt.go:171`.

**Fix:** deletion reverted; `TransformConfig`, `replaceAdapterImport`, `replaceImportBinding`,
`identAlreadyBound`, `injectVersionPin` and `kitBlockRegex` all stay. `ARCHITECTURE.md` and
`mem:state` corrected to say the path is live and name its caller, so the next agent does not
re-derive the same wrong conclusion.

**Preventative rule:** never pipe a reachability, usage or completeness query through `head`, `-m`,
or any other truncation — the whole point of the query is that the absence of a match is the
finding, and truncation makes absence unprovable. Count first (`grep -c`, or read the full list) and
only then narrow. Corollary: before deleting any symbol, let the compiler and `golangci-lint`'s
`unused` check be the oracle rather than a grep — attempt the deletion in a scratch commit and read
what breaks, which is exhaustive by construction where a text search is not. And when a symbol looks
dead because "the pipeline no longer calls it", enumerate the OTHER commands in the CLI before
concluding: a second command with a different mandate is the most likely remaining caller.

## 2026-09-01 — The first build of any project produced a different image digest from every later build, because a label recorded the base reference *as resolved* rather than an invariant one

**Category:** determinism / build-state leakage — a value that varies with local state (a lockfile's existence, a mirror's use) written into content-addressed bytes

**Root cause:** `imageLabels` set `org.opencontainers.image.base.name` from `BaseImageInfo.Ref`.
`Ref` is documented as "the reference that was resolved, as supplied (tag or digest)" — and the
resolver *rebinds* it: to `entry.PinnedRef` (the digest form) once `pokkum.lock` exists, and to
`entry.MirrorRef` when an escrow mirror is in use. That string is baked into the image config, so it
changes the config digest, then the manifest digest, then the index digest.

So the FIRST build of a project recorded `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot` and every build
after it recorded `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12@sha256:9dac…`, for byte-identical source. Two
colleagues building the same commit, one with an escrow mirror configured, likewise disagreed. The
codebase already had the right value and said so: `ports.BaseImage.PinnedRef`'s doc comment reads
"It is what gets recorded in the image labels", and `UpstreamRef`'s reads "never rebound to a mirror
or a locked pinned-digest form". The code used neither.

**How it was caught:** by `benchmarks/three-way` on its first run against a live Docker daemon —
built to produce a marketing number, not to find bugs. Its reproducibility row read `no`. Every
existing test passed, because every one of them exercises a single build; the bug only exists
*between* two builds in different lockfile states, and nothing was comparing those. Localising it
took a byte-level diff of two OCI layouts: 34 of 39 blobs identical, every layer and diffID
identical, one annotation different. Two false starts along the way — an amd64 config compared
against an arm64 one, and a third build that differed for an unrelated reason because a `git commit`
landed between runs and moved `image.revision`.

**Where:** `internal/core/pipeline.go`, `imageLabels`.

**Fix:** `baseNameForLabel` prefers `UpstreamRef`, falls back to `PinnedRef`, and returns `""`
otherwise. `Ref` is not eligible on any path — a fallback chain ending in it would look defensive
and silently reintroduce the bug for exactly the inputs that caused it.
`baselabel_internal_test.go` runs the same logical build through all three rebindings (no lockfile,
lockfile, mirror) and asserts one value; proven to fail with the old line restored, on both the
lockfile and the mirror case. End-to-end: `rm pokkum.lock` then two builds now produce one digest,
where they previously produced two. **Breaking** — every image digest moves once.

**Preventative rule:** before writing any value into an image config, label, annotation or other
content-addressed artifact, ask what it varies with *besides the source*. A field whose doc comment
says "as supplied", "as resolved", "best effort", or that the code rebinds anywhere, is disqualified
by that fact alone. Prefer a field explicitly documented as invariant, and when the same struct
offers both, read the doc comments before picking — this codebase had `UpstreamRef` and `PinnedRef`
sitting beside `Ref`, each documenting exactly this distinction, and the wrong one was still chosen.
Corollary: a reproducibility test that builds once proves nothing. The cheapest real check is
two builds from *different starting states* (no cache/lockfile, then warm) compared byte-for-byte —
which is exactly what the benchmark did by accident and what no unit test did on purpose.

## 2026-09-01 — `pokkum config validate` reported a config valid that `pokkum deploy` then refused, because it validated each profile's raw block instead of the merged one

**Category:** boundary / validator-consumer disagreement — a cross-field validity rule checked against a fragment, while the consumer reads the composition

**Root cause:** `validateConfigFields` is invoked once for the base config and once per profile, each
time with that profile's own raw block. That is correct for every field it validated before, because
each of those is independently valid in isolation: a bad `strategy` is bad whether or not a base
config also sets one.

A `deploy` block is not like that. Its validity is **cross-field** — the `target` determines whether
`method`, `application` and `update_image` are legal — and those fields **inherit** from the base
config through `ApplyProfile`. So a base configuring Dokploy with `update_image: true`, plus a
profile that switches only `target` and `endpoint` to SwiftWave, merges into a configuration that
`core.ResolveDeployRequest` refuses (SwiftWave cannot repoint an application) while
`config validate` reported it valid — each half being fine on its own. The user's fix
(`update_image: false` in the profile) is not discoverable from a validator that says the file is
fine.

**How it was caught:** not by any unit test. Every test asserted on a base block or a profile block,
never on the interaction between them, and all of them passed. It was found by running the real
built binary against a stub control plane through the documented flow — `config validate` printed
"is valid", and the very next command failed on the same file. This is the value the repo's
`paranoid-testing-guide.md` and checklist row 37 already claim for executing documentation rather
than reading it, showing up again.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/config.go`'s `runConfigValidate` and `validateGeneratedConfig`, the per-profile
`validateConfigFields` call sites.

**Fix:** the deploy block is now validated **merged**, via a new
`config.MergeDeployConfig(base, profile)`. That function is exported and called by `ApplyProfile`
itself rather than duplicated in the validator, so there is exactly one implementation of the merge
and the validator cannot drift from what the build actually resolves — the parallel-path class of
row 54. Both per-profile call sites (real config and generated config) use it.
`TestConfigValidateChecksTheMergedDeployBlock` pins it, and asserts first that the base block alone
is valid, so it cannot pass for the wrong reason; it was proven to fail with the fix reverted.

**Preventative rule:** when a config field's validity depends on ANOTHER field that can be inherited
or overridden, the validator must run against the same composition the consumer resolves, not
against the fragment the user typed. Ask, for each new validated field: is this independently valid,
or does its legality depend on a sibling? If the latter, validate the merged result — and reuse the
merge function the consumer uses rather than reimplementing it, or the two will disagree exactly
where it matters. Then check the validator and the consumer agree by executing them back to back on
one real file, which is the only step that finds this.

## 2026-09-01 — Two new PaaS integrations both had a "200 means nothing happened" path, and one had a write that silently clears credentials — both found by reading the platforms' source before writing any code

**Category:** boundary / external-contract — an outbound integration where the remote system's success status is not evidence its action occurred, and a "partial update" that is actually a full overwrite

**Root cause:** the intuitive model of an HTTP integration is "2xx means it worked." That model is
wrong for both platforms Pokkum now deploys to, in ways nothing in their prose documentation says.

SwiftWave's redeploy webhook (`swiftwave_service/rest/webhook.go`) rebuilds an image-sourced
application ONLY if the POST body contains the application's own configured image, reduced to
`owner/name` (tag stripped, then the last two path segments). If it does not, the handler returns
`200` with the body `OK - No rebuild`. An adapter checking only the status code would report a
deploy that changed nothing as a success, indefinitely and silently. Worse, the handler runs
`url.QueryUnescape` over the body first and, on failure, continues with the **empty string** — so a
body containing a stray percent escape also degrades to a silent no-op with a 200.

Dokploy's `application.saveDockerProvider`
(`apps/dokploy/server/api/routers/application.ts`) reads as a targeted "set the image" call. It is
not: the handler writes `dockerImage`, `username`, `password` AND `registryUrl` from the request on
every invocation, and its zod input schema is `.required()` on all five picked fields. So the
obvious payload `{applicationId, dockerImage}` fails validation, and the "fixed" payload that adds
nulls **clears the registry credentials the application pulls with** — a destructive side effect of
a call whose name says nothing about credentials.

**How it was caught:** neither was caught, because neither was written wrong. Both were found before
any adapter code existed, by following checklist row 36 — verify a third-party interop contract
against that consumer's own source, not its error messages or its docs — and reading the two
handlers. The prose documentation for both endpoints describes neither behaviour. A test-first or
docs-first approach would have produced two adapters that appeared to work in every manual check
against a correctly-configured application, and failed silently the first time one was not.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/deploy/swiftwave.go` (`deployViaWebhook`),
`internal/adapters/deploy/dokploy.go` (`saveDockerProvider`, `dokploySaveDockerProviderRequest`).

**Fix:** every response is classified on its BODY, never its status alone. SwiftWave's
`OK - No rebuild` maps to a distinct sentinel, `core.ErrDeployNotTriggered`, with a message naming
the `owner/name` matching rule; the body is posted as `text/plain` carrying the pushed references
and containing no percent escapes. An unrecognised 2xx is an error at both platforms, not a
success. Dokploy's payload uses `*string` **without** `omitempty` so every required key is present
while nullable values stay null; `deploy.update_image` defaults **off**, takes explicit pull
credentials, and reports credential clearing in `DeployResult.Detail` plus a `Warn` log rather than
doing it silently. `core.Deploy` backstops the adapter contract: a `DeployResult` with
`Triggered == false` can never be returned alongside a nil error. Both guards were proven capable
of failing by reverting the behaviour they protect (a naive `isSuccess(status)` branch, and
`omitempty` on the nullable fields) and watching the tests fail by name.

**Preventative rule:** for any call to an external system that performs a side effect, a success
status is a claim about *delivery*, not about *the action*. Identify, from that system's own source,
every response it emits for "received your request and deliberately did nothing" — and make each one
an error with its own diagnosis. Separately, before writing any call that updates a remote resource,
read the handler to determine whether it patches or overwrites: a name like `saveXProvider` or
`updateX` says nothing about which, and an overwrite reached through a partial-looking payload
destroys the fields the payload omitted.

## 2026-08-23 — The published GitHub Action never loaded at all: an example expression written as documentation inside an input's `description` failed the manifest for every consumer, in every release

**Category:** boundary / evaluated-position — text intended as documentation sat in a
position the platform evaluates, and the artifact was never executed

**Root cause:** `action.yml`'s `tags` input carried, as an illustrative example in its
`description`, the literal text `latest,v1.2.3,{{ github.sha }}` (in expression syntax).
GitHub evaluates input descriptions while loading an action manifest, and the `github`
context is not available in that position, so every single use of this action died with

    Unrecognized named-value: 'github' ... Failed to load action.yml

before one step executed. It was present from the action's first commit through v1.0.6.
The published Marketplace action had therefore **never worked for anyone**, and the three
defects logged in the entry below it — the ignored `--log-format` spelling, `ref` read off
the base image, `digest` read off the startup attestation — were all downstream of code
that had never once run.

The position matters, not the syntax: the sibling `setup-pokkum` action carries
`{{ github.token }}` in an input's `default` and loads fine, which is what identified
`description` specifically rather than "expressions in inputs" generally.

**How it was caught:** by the CI job added in the entry below, on its first execution.
The job's purpose was to catch the three output-parsing defects; it found a fourth,
strictly more severe one, in a line nobody had edited — including in a prior pass that
rewrote every comment *around* that line for documentation correctness. Reading the file
carefully, twice, with the manifest in view, found nothing. Running it found it in
thirty seconds.

**Where:** `action.yml`, `inputs.tags.description`.

**Fix:** the example is now plain prose, and the explanation of why moved into a YAML
comment, which is stripped before evaluation. The install step also stopped routing
`github.action_ref` through an expression and reads the runner-provided
`GITHUB_ACTION_REF` environment variable instead — no expression means no question of
which contexts are available where. `TestActionYMLNoExpressionsOutsideEvaluatedPositions`
walks every string in every manifest this repo ships and fails on an expression outside
the positions observed to work, and was confirmed to fail against the actual v1.0.6
manifest (`git show v1.0.6:action.yml`) before being committed. The injection guard was
tightened in the same pass to stop exempting shell comments: substitution runs over the
whole script text, so a value containing a newline ends the comment and executes.

**Preventative rule:** folded into `mem:self_review_checklist` row 58, which already
required that a published integration artifact be executed by CI rather than
string-checked. This incident sharpens it with the reason that is easy to miss: the
failure was not in logic, it was in a **documentation string**, in a file that had been
reviewed for documentation accuracy. Prose is not inert. Any field a platform evaluates —
a manifest description, a template default, a label, an annotation — is code, and an
example written in that field's own expression syntax is an instruction, not an
illustration. Reviewing such a file for correctness cannot substitute for loading it,
because the reviewer reads the example as documentation exactly as the author intended,
which is the one reading the platform will not take.

## 2026-08-23 — The published GitHub Action's `digest` and `ref` outputs were empty on every run since v1.0.0, and the code path that would have populated them was reading the base image

**Category:** boundary / shadow-parser drift — a hand-rolled pre-parse accepted a
narrower input surface than the real parser it runs ahead of, and nothing executed the
artifact that depended on it

**Root cause:** three defects stacked in one ten-line block of `action.yml`, none of
them reachable by any test, because `uses: ./` appeared in no workflow — neither
composite action this repository publishes had ever been executed by anything.

1. `cmd/pokkum/main.go`'s `flag()` pre-parses `--log-level`/`--log-format` out of raw
   `os.Args`, because the logger must exist before cobra parses anything. It matched
   only the attached `--flag=value` spelling. Both flags are *also* registered as
   ordinary cobra persistent flags, so the separated `--log-format json` spelling —
   which `action.yml` used — parsed with no error and had no effect whatsoever. Logs
   stayed in text format. This is the shape that makes shadow parsers dangerous: the
   real parser accepted the input, so nothing anywhere reported a problem.
2. The step then grepped that stream for the **first** `"ref"` key. In a build log the
   first `ref` is the resolved **base image**. Any workflow following
   `docs/GITHUB_ACTION.md`'s own quickstart — which pipes `steps.pokkum.outputs.ref`
   into a deploy step — would have deployed `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12`.
3. Likewise the first `"digest"` key is the startup-attestation digest, a bare 64-hex
   string with no `sha256:` prefix — not the published manifest digest.

Defect 1 masked 2 and 3 completely. With text-format logs nothing matched either
pattern, so both outputs were merely *empty* rather than wrong, and fixing the flag
alone would have converted a visibly broken action into a silently wrong one.

`cmd/pokkum/actionyml_test.go` existed and passed throughout, because it checks that
the flag *names* `action.yml` emits exist on `pokkum build` — a string comparison
against the cobra flag set. Every flag involved here was real. The bug was in what the
script did with the flag's output, which no static check over flag names can see.

**How it was caught:** by running the thing. Building the CI job that executes `uses: ./`
required first establishing what a real invocation produces, so a tarball build was run
locally with the action's exact argument list. The `--log-format json` output came back
in text format, which surfaced defect 1 within seconds; simulating the action's own grep
against a genuine JSON log then surfaced 2 and 3 immediately. Re-reading the script,
which had already survived a documentation-correctness pass that rewrote every
surrounding comment, produced none of them.

**Where:** `action.yml` ("Execute Pokkum Build"), `cmd/pokkum/main.go`'s `flag()`.

**Fix:** `flag()` now accepts both spellings, stopping at a bare `--` and refusing to
consume a flag-shaped next argument (one residual case — the literal string
`--log-format` passed as another flag's *value* — is knowingly out of reach and
documented at the function, since resolving it needs the flag table cobra has not built
yet). The action no longer parses logs at all: it reads the reference off **stdout**,
whose contract `internal/core/pipeline.go` states exactly — "exactly one line is written
here — the published `repo@sha256:…` reference — because that string is what a CI
pipeline captures and feeds to the next step" — with the digest split off the `@`. The
match is anchored, which is load-bearing: the dry-run summary contains an *indented*
base-image `@sha256:` line that an unanchored pattern picks up. Two new CI jobs execute
the action for real (a tarball build asserting the ref names the requested repository and
agrees with the digest, and a clean-runner dry-run asserting both outputs are empty and
the CLI actually installed), plus `setup-pokkum` on a third. Every assertion was verified
to reject each of the three defects' actual values before being committed.

**Preventative rule:** two rules, both now in `mem:self_review_checklist`.
(a) *Shadow parser* — when code hand-parses an input that a real parser also handles
(a flag pre-read before the flag library runs, an env-var fast path, a regex ahead of a
full decoder), enumerate every spelling the real parser accepts and confirm the shadow
accepts them all. Divergence here is silent by construction: the authoritative parser
validates the input, so the user gets no error, just no effect. This is row 54's
parallel-path drift in its most invisible form, because the two paths are not peers —
one runs first and wins, and the other's success is what hides it. (b) *Published
integration artifacts must be executed* — a GitHub Action, installer script, container
entrypoint or any other file this repo ships for someone else's runtime has to be run
by CI, not string-checked. A static guard over such a file constrains its vocabulary,
never its behaviour, and its passing is easily mistaken for coverage: `actionyml_test.go`
was written after an earlier `action.yml` bug and gave exactly that false assurance
while three worse bugs shipped in the same file.

## 2026-08-22 — Sorting the output hid a nondeterministic choice of what went into it

**Category:** determinism
**Root cause:** Every npm-family lockfile can record one package name at several
versions — a hoisted copy plus nested copies belonging to some dependency. All four
parsers built their name-keyed catalogue by ranging over the parsed `packages` **map**,
so Go's randomized iteration order decided which duplicate won. Two SBOMs of an
unchanged project therefore disagreed on package versions, and — because the same loop
built the reachability graph that assigns production/development scope — on how many
packages the document contained at all. Six builds of identical source produced 9, 10,
11, 13, 14 and 15 packages, and six SBOM documents with six different SHA-256s.

The reason this survived review is the interesting part: the *output* was carefully
sorted, with a comment explaining that the document's package order must be fully
deterministic. It is. Sorting a list assembled by a nondeterministic selection produces
a stably-ordered list of unstable contents, and looks exactly like the fix.
**Where:** `internal/adapters/scannerutils/scannerutils.go` — `ParseBunLock`,
`ParsePackageLock` (v2 path), `extractV1Dependencies`, `ParsePnpmLock`
**Fix:** Iterate keys in sorted order and make the winner an explicit rule rather than
an accident: the hoisted copy wins, because it is the one at `node_modules/<name>` that
a bare import actually resolves to. Found in `bun.lock` first; the other three parsers
had the identical defect and were fixed in the same pass.
**Preventative rule:** A sorted output proves nothing about determinism if the values
being sorted were *selected* nondeterministically. For any map range whose body writes
into a keyed collection, ask what happens when two iterations target the same key —
if either can win, the result is random, and no amount of downstream sorting recovers
it. Fix it where the collision is resolved, not where the output is ordered.

## 2026-08-22 — A feature only ran for input it was supposed to be unnecessary for

**Category:** boundary / coupling
**Root cause:** The `kit.version.name` reproducibility pin was implemented as a side effect of
staging a Vite config during *adapter injection*. Injection only runs when the project's
adapter is wrong, so the pin only ran for misconfigured projects. A correctly configured
project got no injection, no pin, and a `Date.now()` version name that renames every hashed
client chunk — inverting the tool's central claim, and doing so in the direction where nobody
looks, because "correctly configured project builds fine" is what you expect to see. Measured
on a real project: two builds of an unchanged tree emitted different `version.json` values and
differed in two OCI layers.
**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go` `Prepare`
**Fix:** The pin runs as its own guard, independent of injection: stage a config to pin it
where the build script is exactly `vite build`, warn loudly where the script does more and
taking it over would skip the rest.
**Preventative rule:** When a capability is implemented inside a conditional path that exists
for a *different* reason (an injection, a repair, a fallback), state which inputs reach it and
confirm that set matches the inputs the capability is *for*. A capability that piggybacks on a
fix-up path inherits that path's trigger condition — usually "the input was broken" — which is
frequently the exact complement of the set it should cover.

---

## 2026-08-22 — `else if` chained to a different `if` than its indentation showed

**Category:** control-flow
**Root cause:** The first fix for the entry above was hung off the injection block as
`} else if ... {`. The block above it is deeply nested, so the `else` bound to an inner `if`,
not the outer one it lined up with visually. Go accepts this silently, `gofmt` leaves it
alone (the indentation *is* consistent with the real binding), the build is clean, and all
five verification steps pass — the branch simply never executes. Debug logging *before* the
`if` printed the expected values, which made the condition look satisfied and sent the
investigation after the predicate rather than after the branch.
**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go` `Prepare`
**Fix:** Rewritten as a standalone `if` with an explicit `!runViteWrapper` condition instead of
an `else`, plus `TestPrepare_PinsVersionNameWhenAdapterAlreadyCorrect`, which drives `Prepare`
end to end and fails against both the original bug and the non-executing fix.
**Preventative rule:** A new branch is not verified by reading its condition or by logging the
values that feed it — only by observing an effect that exists solely inside it. Prefer a
standalone `if` over an `else if` when the preceding block is long or deeply nested, and put
the probe *inside* the new branch, never just before it.

---

## 2026-08-22 — The reproducibility fix reached only misconfigured projects, because the passthrough path got the manifest sort but not the version pin

**Category:** parallel-path drift — the same shape as the entry two below, created in the code written to fix it

**Root cause:** the remote-manifest sort could only be delivered through a Vite config Pokkum authors, and Pokkum authored one only when the adapter needed injecting. `PrepareVirtualViteConfigPassthrough` was added so projects whose adapter is already correct — the documented happy path, and the *only* possible path under SvelteKit 3, where `svelte.config.js` is a hard error — would get it too. It applied `remoteManifestSortPrelude` and stopped there; `injectVersionPin`, the other half of determinism, was never called. Those projects still emitted SvelteKit's default `Date.now()` version name into `_app/version.json`, which changes every downstream client chunk hash. The net effect was close to the opposite of the intent: the reproducibility work applied to projects configured wrongly, and not to those configured correctly.

**How it was caught:** two independent signals within minutes — an agent promoting a SvelteKit 3 fixture read the two paths side by side and noticed the asymmetry, and a pristine two-build test of `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node` produced different digests. Measured: passthrough config `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` count 0 against the injection path's 1, and `{"version":"1787380297729"}` vs `{"version":"1787380341039"}`. No test found it; the byte comparison did.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/injector.go`, `PrepareVirtualViteConfigPassthrough`.

**Fix:** `pinViteConfigVersion` applies the pin on the passthrough path, and both paths now draw the property text from one shared `viteVersionProp` const so they cannot drift again. The bare-`sveltekit()`-with-a-`svelte.config.js` case is deliberately left unpinned — SvelteKit ignores that file the moment the plugin receives any argument, so injecting one would discard the project's aliases, csp and prerender settings — and now warns, naming both ways out. Verified from pristine state on all three paths (adapter-injected SK2, passthrough SK2, passthrough SK3), two builds each, byte-compared.

**Preventative rule:** when a fix is delivered through a mechanism with more than one entry point, enumerate the entry points and confirm it reaches all of them before claiming it lands — and say which ones were actually measured rather than generalising from the one tested. Adding a second entry point to a mechanism is itself the moment to re-run the full checklist of what that mechanism must do, not only the part that motivated the addition.

## 2026-08-22 — `crane validate` rejected every multi-arch image Pokkum ever produced, because the index descriptor's platform was synthesized from Pokkum's own narrower vocabulary

**Category:** vocabulary narrower than the external format it is written into

**Root cause:** `packager.Index` stamped each index descriptor from `ports.Platform`, which models only OS/Arch/Variant and carries `Variant: ""` for both supported platforms. The child *config* is a deep copy of the resolved base image's config, and `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12`'s arm64 image declares `variant: v8`. So the descriptor said `linux/arm64` while the config it pointed at said `linux/arm64/v8`, and go-containerregistry's `validate` compares exactly those two with `Platform.Equals`. Every multi-arch image failed `crane validate --remote` on `platform[1]`, in every output mode, with an **empty** error — gcr's own `validatePlatform` has no `Variant` clause, checking `OSVersion` twice instead, so it detects a mismatch it cannot describe.

**Why nothing caught it:** the golden tests build children on `helper_test.go`'s `syntheticBase`, which sets `cfg.Variant = plat.Variant`, i.e. `""`. The fixture cannot reproduce the one property of the real base image that causes the bug, so the golden index digest is genuinely unaffected and the tests were green on an input that could not exhibit it. Every in-repo assertion round-tripped Pokkum's own vocabulary against itself; nothing ever asked an external OCI tool whether the artifact was well-formed.

**Fix:** `descriptorPlatform` reads the resolved child's `ConfigFile().Platform()` and uses that, deep-copied because `Equals` sorts `OSFeatures` in place. `"v8"` is never named — the value is whatever the base declared — and `OSVersion`/`OSFeatures` ride along for the same reason. The fan-out key is still enforced, so a mislabelled child remains `core.ErrUnsupportedPlatform`. This moves the index digest of affected builds.

**Preventative rule:** an internal type that is deliberately a *subset* of an external format may be used to select and to check, but must never be the *source* of bytes written into that format — derive those from the artifact the descriptor describes, or the two disagree the moment an upstream input populates a field the subset cannot hold. And at least one acceptance check should be an external tool run against a real artifact (`crane validate`), not only in-repo assertions written in the same vocabulary as the code under test.

## 2026-08-21 — A commit closed a roadmap item whose whole point was a measurement that was never taken

**Category:** verification-gap / process

**Root cause:** `generic-secret-rule-key-coverage` existed *because* widening the generic secret rule's key set spends false-positive budget that the immediately preceding tightening had just recovered. Its Recommendation was explicit: "validated against a corpus of real minified bundles so the false-positive cost is measured rather than assumed." Commit `5af6a29` shipped the regex widening with a good commit message, a fail-first proof, and ten new tests — and no corpus. Its false-positive tests were hand-written strings built from the author's model of minified output, checked against a regex built from the same model. The item was left `status: open`, so nothing downstream noticed the obligation was outstanding. Running the measurement later found the regex was in fact safe on 219 files / 2.65 MiB of real Vite/Rollup output — but that was luck, not evidence, and the real sweep surfaced a false-positive class no synthetic fixture would have produced (Vite's bundled `js-tokens` lexer reassigning `lastSignificantToken` to sentinel strings; unreachable today only because `ScanDirectory` skips `node_modules`).

**Where:** `internal/adapters/secretguard/guard.go`; roadmap item `generic-secret-rule-key-coverage`.

**Fix:** `internal/adapters/secretguard/minified_corpus_test.go` makes the measurement permanent, with floors on file count, byte count and longest line so a shrunken or de-minified corpus fails loudly rather than passing vacuously, plus a companion test that splices a credential into a real 29 215-character minified line so the zero is a scan that *can* fail. Item closed with the measured numbers recorded in its `decision`.

**Preventative rule:** when a roadmap item's Recommendation names a *validation method* — a corpus, a real specimen, a benchmark — that method is acceptance criteria, not advice. Do not mark the item `shipped` until it has been run and its output recorded. A commit message asserting a trade-off is safe is not the same artefact as a measurement showing it. Corollary: shipping the code while leaving the item `open` is the worst of both — the code lands, the obligation silently doesn't, and the next reader sees an open item whose fix is already in `main`.

## 2026-08-21 — Three verification-adjacent checks each answered "clean/valid" from no evidence, in three different packages

**Category:** fail-open — the shape `mem:core` records as having already recurred three times, found three more times in one pass

**Root cause:** all three follow the same template: a check whose failure path returns the *reassuring* value.

1. `internal/adapters/cosign/signer.go` required the payload type `atomic container signature` and rejected `cosign container image signature`, which is what cosign has written for years — so static-key base-image verification could not succeed for any input. Worse, the check runs *before* any signature maths, so a correct key and a wrong key produced byte-identical errors. The lenient two-type form already existed in `baseimage/resolver.go` and `provenance/resolver.go`, each with a comment explaining why both are needed; the fix had never reached this third copy.
2. `internal/adapters/provenance/resolver.go`'s `--expect-source` compared commits with an unbounded `strings.HasPrefix`. A one-character assertion (`repo@b`) matched roughly one commit in sixteen and returned success, and because `<sha>` is a prefix of `<sha>-dirty`, asserting the exact clean commit silently accepted an image built from uncommitted modifications — the precise case the flag exists to catch.
3. `internal/adapters/slsa/gitdiscovery.go`'s `workingTreeDirty` returned `false` — "clean" — whenever the `git status` subprocess itself failed. Its own doc comment describes replacing `repro doctor`'s hardcoded-`true` version of this same bug; the replacement inverted the constant instead of removing it. This one had just been made more consequential: the OCI version label had been wired to it hours earlier, so an unavailable git would have produced a label claiming a clean tree.

**Where:** the three files above, plus `cmd/pokkum/repro_doctor.go` and `cmd/pokkum/git_metadata.go` as consumers.

**Fix:** (1) accepts both Simple Signing type strings, with the error naming both. (2) a `minAbbreviatedCommitLen` of 7 (git's own default abbreviation) and an explicit refusal when a clean assertion matches a `-dirty` provenance. (3) `WorkingTreeDirty` returns `(bool, error)`; an unavailable git reports *dirty* plus the error, `repro doctor` reports a distinct `INCONCLUSIVE` outcome rather than a pass, and the version label consults it only inside a real git repository — a directory under no version control is out of scope, not unverifiable.

**Preventative rule:** for any predicate whose name implies safety (`isValid`, `isClean`, `verify`), enumerate every `return` on an error path and ask what a caller does with that value. If the error path returns the same value as the success path, the function cannot report failure and its callers cannot distinguish "checked and fine" from "could not check" — give it an error return or a tri-state. And when a lenient/strict decision is made about a wire format, grep for every implementation of that decision: this codebase had three, and fixed two.

## 2026-08-21 — The SBOM was attached as an unsigned blob nothing bound to the image, so a signed image's SBOM could be swapped undetected

**Category:** fail-open — a supply-chain document presented as evidence while nothing authenticated it

**Root cause:** `AttachSBOM` published the SPDX document under the `.sbom` tag as a bare blob. Its manifest carried `subject: null` and no annotations, the SPDX document itself never named the image digest (`documentDescribes` absent), and the signed SLSA provenance's `resolvedDependencies` never referenced it. So nothing tied the SBOM to the image and nothing signed it. An independent tester pushed a doctored one-package SBOM over the `.sbom` tag of a **signed, self-verified** image; `pokkum verify` still returned `ATTESTATION_VALIDATED`, and `cosign verify` and `cosign verify-attestation` both still passed. Anyone with push access could make a signed image claim any dependency inventory they liked.

**Where:** `internal/core/pipeline.go` (stage 10 / `signAndSelfVerify`), `internal/adapters/registry/attestation.go`.

**Fix:** the SBOM is now wrapped in an in-toto Statement whose `subject` is the image digest, DSSE-signed with the build's key, and attached as a second layer of the same `.att` attachment — cosign's convention for multiple attestations, distinguished by `predicateType`. `cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson` resolves and verifies it with no Pokkum in the loop, and the SLSA provenance stays layer 0 so `FetchAttestation`'s `layers[0]` contract and the post-push self-verification are untouched. The signing test now asserts *which* predicate types were signed and that each statement names the pushed digest, rather than counting signer calls — a count is satisfied by signing the same statement twice.

Considered and rejected for now: recording the SBOM's hash in the provenance (weaker — needs a bespoke verifier), and signing the `.sbom` manifest itself (binds to the SBOM, not to the image). The legacy `.sbom` tag is still published for compatibility and is still unauthenticated; consumers should prefer the attestation.

**Preventative rule:** an artifact published *as evidence about* another artifact must name its subject and be signed, or it is decoration. The test is not "can I fetch it" but "can someone who can write to this repository replace it without any verification path failing" — ask that of every attachment a build produces, and answer it by actually performing the swap rather than by reading the attach code.

## 2026-08-21 — Every project whose vite.config.ts calls sveltekit() directly produced unreproducible images, because only the svelte.config.js injection path pinned kit.version

**Category:** boundary / parallel-path drift — one of two injection paths gained a step the other never did

**Root cause:** `sveltekitutils.TransformConfig` (the `svelte.config.js` path) pins `kit.version.name` to `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` at its step 2. `TransformViteConfig` — the path taken when a project's `vite.config.ts` calls `sveltekit()` itself, which is the officially supported pattern and the one Vitest's `projects:` config requires — never had an equivalent step. SvelteKit then falls back to its default version name of `Date.now()`, which lands in the client bundle as `_app/version.json`'s `{"version":"1787339446040"}` and cascades through every downstream Vite chunk hash: roughly fifty renamed `.js`/`.gz`/`.br` files and two differing OCI layers between two builds of identical committed source. Nothing warned that pinning had been skipped, and `README.md` promises "bit-for-bit reproducible builds out of the box".

Found by an independent tester executing `paranoid-testing-guide.md` §13 as written — two builds, `sha256sum`, then a real byte-level `diff -rq` of the extracted tarballs — on a real project. A second tester, working blind on a different section, independently reported two consecutive builds producing different index digests with two layers differing in size. Neither was looking for this; the guide's insistence on diffing bytes rather than trusting digest equality is what surfaced it. Every fixture in the repo uses the `svelte.config.js` path, so no test could see it.

`pokkum verify --against <tarball>` correctly reported `ERR_COMPARISON_MISMATCH` throughout — the verifier was honest, the build was not.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/injector.go`, `TransformViteConfig`.

**Fix:** `injectViteVersionPin` inserts `version: { name: process.env.SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH || 'pokkum-reproducible-build' }` into the flat options object, which the Vite form routes into `kit`. It is inserted first, ahead of any spread, so a project that sets its own version still wins (later keys and spreads override earlier ones), and it no-ops entirely if the args already mention `version`. The two tests asserting the injected output were updated to assert the version pin **alongside** the adapter rather than being loosened.

**Preventative rule:** when a feature exists as two parallel implementations of "the same" transformation — two config formats, two output modes, two runtimes — a step added to one is not added to the other, and no compiler or test will say so. Enumerate the steps of both paths side by side whenever either changes, and prefer a shared, ordered pipeline over two hand-maintained sequences. Corollary for reproducibility specifically: a digest comparison is not a byte comparison, and only the byte comparison localises *what* differs — the guide's §13 instruction to diff extracted tarballs, not digests, is what turned "the digests differ" into a one-line root cause.

## 2026-08-21 — The only test that boots a produced image passed throughout the startup-attestation outage, because its fixture has no production dependencies

**Category:** fixture fidelity / coverage-shape — a test that exercises the right code path against an input that structurally cannot contain the bug

**Root cause:** `tests/integration/runtime_smoke_test.go` boots a real layered image and polls its probes, and `ci.yml` describes it as the only test that does. It ran, booted and served throughout the outage that made every layered image exit 125. `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node` declares every package under `devDependencies` and has no `dependencies` at all, so `bunexec`'s `stageProductionDependencies` runs `bun install --production`, correctly finds nothing, and returns `""`; `pkgReq.AppNodeModulesDir` stays empty; the packager's `if req.AppNodeModulesDir != ""` branch never runs; and no node_modules records enter the attestation on *either* side. The two halves then agree trivially. Verified by reverting the fix on both sides, rebuilding the embedded PID-1 blobs and re-running `make e2e-runtime-smoke`: **PASS**, with the container logging `startup attestation verified ... files=79`. That `79` is the whole story — a boot test proves the image boots with the content it was given, and if the fixture omits the category the bug lives in, "it booted" is a claim about 79 files, not about the product.

Secondary, same shape one level up: none of the smoke tests' skip paths were observable. Every gate was a bare `t.Skip`, so on a runner where Docker, Bun and the fixture deps are all guaranteed, a lost daemon would have printed `ok` while asserting nothing — row 47's exact failure mode, sitting on the repo's only boot coverage. Six steps in `ci.yml` also still lacked `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}`.

**Where:** `tests/integration/runtime_smoke_test.go`, `runtime_smoke_node_test.go`; `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node/package.json` (devDependencies only); `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `e2e-real-build` job.

**Fix:** the smoke tests now inject a real production dependency into their *scratch copy* of the fixture, delivered as a local npm **tarball** (`file:/abs/....tgz`) — a `file:` pointing at a directory installs as symlinks, which the packager excludes from both the layer and the attestation records, so that variant would have reproduced the same zero coverage. The image is then asserted to carry the dependency at its exact nested in-image path, and `pokkum-init`'s `startup attestation verified ... files=N` is asserted to equal the number of regular members the *shipped image* carries under `ports.AttestationRoots` — an oracle read out of the artifact rather than out of the packager's table. Reverting the fix now fails the test with the real production error. Coverage went from `files=79` (0 under node_modules) to `files=82` (3 under node_modules). Every environmental gate now routes through `smokeGateSkipf`, which `POKKUM_REQUIRE_RUNTIME_SMOKE=1` converts into a hard failure naming the unmet precondition; CI sets it, and additionally scans the run output for `--- SKIP` and enforces a floor on passing smoke tests. Two Go tests parse `ci.yml` itself, since the workflow cannot be executed locally.

**Preventative rule:** for a test whose entire value is that it exercises the real artifact, ask what the fixture makes *impossible* before trusting a green result — an e2e test inherits its coverage from its input, and a fixture omitting a whole category of shipped content (production dependencies, prerendered pages, native modules) silently narrows the claim to whatever it happens to contain. Assert the coverage, not just the outcome: add a floor on how much of the artifact the run actually touched, derived from the artifact. And a test whose preconditions are guaranteed by the environment that runs it must be *unable* to skip there — convert the skip into a failure via an explicit env var **and** scan the run output, because the env var only reaches gates written to consult it while a `-run` pattern matching nothing reaches none of them. Covered by `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 12 and 47.

## 2026-08-21 — The SBOM's unresolved-version marker had a real test, but a single-item fixture and no CycloneDX coverage at all

**Category:** multi-item — a per-item conditional proven only against a document containing one item

**Root cause:** `TestGenerator_SPDX_UnresolvablePackageIsMarkedDistinctly` already drove the real `Generate()` path and asserted `p.Comment != ""` for an unresolvable package — a genuine test, not a fabrication. But its fixture held only that one package, so it could not distinguish "the marker tracks `Resolved` per-package" from "the marker is unconditional", and an assertion on non-emptiness would have passed against any placeholder text rather than the sentinel the generator actually defines. The CycloneDX renderer's `pokkum:versionResolved` property (`generator.go` ~line 502) had no test in any shape, so one of the two shipped SBOM formats emitted the marker with zero coverage. Worth recording separately: an initial grep for the identifiers `unresolvedVersionComment|versionResolved` across `internal/adapters/sbom/*_test.go` returned nothing and was briefly taken as "zero coverage" — the existing test references neither identifier, so a negative grep on implementation names said nothing about behavioural coverage.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sbom/resolved_version_test.go`; `internal/adapters/sbom/generator.go`'s `renderSPDXJSON`/`renderCycloneDXJSON`.

**Fix:** a shared `mixedResolutionFixture` containing one dependency with a real `node_modules` install (declared `^2.0.0`, installed `2.3.4`) and one range with no lockfile entry and no install, plus one mixed-fixture test per format asserting the resolved package carries **no** marker and the unresolvable one carries the exact sentinel text / exact property value. Both proven capable of failing by neutering all three `if !p.Resolved` guards and observing real assertion failures, then restoring.

**Preventative rule:** a single-item "X is marked" test for a per-item conditional is not evidence the condition is per-item — a fixture must contain siblings that take *different* paths through the same logic, even when a test for the flag already exists in isolation. When one piece of per-item state is rendered into more than one output format, each format needs its own assertion: passing in one says nothing about the other's rendering branch. And never infer coverage from grepping implementation identifiers across test files — tests assert on behaviour and often name none of them.

## 2026-08-21 — Adding `/app/node_modules` to the packager's attestation manifest without adding it to pokkum-init's walk set made every layered image refuse to start, while the whole test suite stayed green

**Category:** boundary / mirrored-constant drift — two processes required to agree on a set, with the agreement asserted by a comment instead of enforced by a shared value

**Root cause:** the fix that made images self-contained (shipping production dependencies at `AppNodeModulesDirPrefix`) folded the node_modules layer's per-file records into `attestRecords`, so the build-time manifest covered 11762 files. `pokkum-init`'s `attestRoots` — a hand-copy that cannot import `ports`, for a documented and still-valid reason — was not updated, so the runtime walk covered 509. The two digests could never match and every layered image exited 125 with `startup attestation mismatch`, on both runtimes and on both `--local` and registry-push outputs. Confirmed byte-for-byte from an exported container rootfs: `digest(roots only)` reproduced the runtime's "got" and `digest(roots+node_modules)` reproduced the build's stamped "expected".

The deeper problem was that the root set existed as **three** hardcoded copies plus an implicit fourth, and the one named as authoritative bound nothing. `ports.AttestationRoots` — whose doc comment says both sides "iterate exactly this set" — was referenced by no production code at all; the packager derived records from wherever it happened to append them, `pokkum-init` kept its literal, and `attestutils_test.go`'s `walkSupervisor` kept a *third* inline list whose own doc comment claimed it walked `AttestationRoots` while hardcoding five prefixes. So the constant that was supposed to prevent drift was itself the only copy that stayed correct, and nothing read it.

Nothing failed. `TestParity_PackagerAndSupervisorAgreeOnSameTree` compares the two digest *functions* on a synthetic tree and never exercises a packager root set at all (it feeds `walkSupervisor`'s output through both hash implementations). `TestAttestationEnv_StampedForLayered` compares the stamp against `recomputeLayeredDigest`, an oracle built from the packager's *own* host-directory table — which had the same omission — and the test never set `AppNodeModulesDir`, so no dependency file entered the digest under test. `TestBuild_LayeredPackagesNodeModulesWhereResolutionLooks` asserted only that a `History` entry named the layer. `go test ./...` reported 49/49 packages ok while no image Pokkum produced could start. Found by a field test that ran a container, not by reading code.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/packager/packager.go` (the `attestRecords = append(attestRecords, nmRecs...)` site), `internal/ports/packager.go`'s `AttestationRoots`, `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-init/attest.go`'s `attestRoots`.

**Fix:** `AppNodeModulesDirPrefix` added to `ports.AttestationRoots` and to `pokkum-init`'s mirror. The mirror is no longer trusted on faith: `TestAttestationRoots_MatchSupervisorMirror` parses the real `attestRoots` declaration out of `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-init/attest.go` with `go/ast` and compares it to `ports.AttestationRoots` as a set, refusing outright if an element is not a plain string literal it can read. `walkSupervisor` now iterates `ports.AttestationRoots` instead of its own copy, removing the third list. `TestAttestation_StampedDigestMatchesImageFilesystem` builds a real layered image with every root populated, replays every layer's tar into a merged filesystem, walks `AttestationRoots` over *that*, and compares to the stamped digest — an oracle derived from the artifact rather than from the packager's bookkeeping. Both guards were proven capable of failing by removing the root from each side independently and watching them fail (and `TestAttestation_ImageFilesystemOracleCanFail` / `TestAttestationRoots_MirrorCheckCanFail` pin that capability). End-to-end: a real image now logs `startup attestation verified ... files=11762` and serves `/login` with the control enabled and no network.

**Preventative rule:** when two separately-compiled programs must agree on a set and one of them cannot import the other's definition, the hand-copy must be *parsed and compared by a test*, not reviewed. A comment saying "keep these in sync" is not a control — it fails silently and only at runtime, in the artifact, after every green check. And an oracle for a packaged artifact must be derived from the artifact (replay the layers) rather than from the inputs the packager was handed: an oracle built from the producer's own table can only confirm the producer agrees with itself, so it agrees with the bug. Extends `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 17 and 21.

## 2026-08-21 — `pokkum scan` fabricated a CVE against a version the project does not use, because "found nothing" and "could not check" shared one representation

**Category:** fabricated data in a success path — a placeholder that a guard condition could not distinguish from a real result

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/scanner/adapter.go` appended `checkEmbeddedAdvisories(req.AppRuntime, ports.DefaultBunVersion, "2.2.0")` whenever `len(toolchainAdvisories) == 0`, so that "there's always a fallback advisory". The literal was chosen deliberately (see the 2026-08-19 comparator entry) to be numerically older than the embedded kit advisory's `FixedVersion`. But the *condition* was wrong: an empty advisory list is also exactly what a successful scan of an up-to-date project looks like. A field test on a project running `@sveltejs/kit` 2.68.0 was told it had a medium CSRF advisory against `@sveltejs/kit` **2.2.0** — a version it has never used. Online, real OSV results filled the list and masked it; offline it was the only advisory reported, so `scan --offline` was simultaneously honest about coverage (`incomplete: true`, correctly) and wrong about findings. Three existing tests had come to depend on the fabrication without saying so. Two passed no `Target` at all, defaulting to `"."` (no `package.json`), and asserted on the advisory the fallback invented. The third, `TestScanCommand_FailsOnExceededThreshold`, declared `@sveltejs/kit` **2.15.0** — numerically *newer* than the advisory's `FixedVersion` and therefore not vulnerable — and still expected the scan to fail; it had been asserting the right outcome for entirely the wrong reason, and would have kept passing if the threshold logic itself broke.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/scanner/adapter.go`, the `if len(toolchainAdvisories) == 0` block.

**Fix:** a `toolchainResolved` flag records whether a real check actually ran against a resolved version. When it did, its result stands — including an empty one. When it did not, the scan is marked `incomplete` with an explicit warning instead of inventing a finding, reusing the reduced-coverage machinery the scanner already has. The two tests that silently relied on the placeholder now use a fixture declaring a genuinely vulnerable version, so their advisory comes from the real resolve-and-compare path.

**Preventative rule:** never let "checked and found nothing" and "could not check" share a representation — the moment they do, any fallback keyed on emptiness fires on healthy inputs. Track the distinction explicitly (a `resolved` bool), and prefer reporting reduced coverage over synthesising a finding: a placeholder emitted into a user-facing security report is fabricated data in a success path, regardless of how defensible the placeholder's *value* was. Corollary for tests: a test that asserts on a finding without declaring the input that produces it may be depending on a fallback rather than on the behaviour it names.

## 2026-08-19 — Moving a trust-root file read to the composition root exposed a second consumer that had been silently swallowing the read error and degrading to the embedded snapshot

**Category:** boundary / fail-open — a fallible read whose failure was discarded by an `if err == nil` shape, in a security control whose whole purpose is to override a default

**Root cause:** `--sigstore-trusted-root` fed two consumers from two independent `os.ReadFile` calls. The base-image consumer (`ports.BaseImageRequest.TrustedRootPath`, read inside `internal/adapters/baseimage`) failed closed on an unreadable file, wrapping `core.ErrBaseSignatureInvalid`. The remote-cache consumer, forty lines further down the same function, was written as `if data, err := os.ReadFile(...); err == nil { req.CacheVerify.TrustedRootJSON = data }` — an unreadable file left the field empty, which every downstream consumer correctly interprets as "use the embedded public-good snapshot". So an operator pointing at a private Sigstore deployment's trust root, with a typo'd or unreadable path, had their cache signatures verified against the *public-good* root while the build reported success. The failure mode is the exact substitution the flag exists to prevent, and it was invisible: no warning, no log line, no non-zero exit. It was found only because converting `TrustedRootPath` from a path to bytes (roadmap item `trusted-root-bytes`) required reading the file in the composition root and therefore reading both call sites side by side. `pokkum verify`'s handling of the same flag already had the correct shape and a comment explaining why — so the codebase contained its own answer, in a third place nobody was comparing against.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/build.go`'s `buildRequestFromConfigAndFlags`, the `req.CacheVerify.TrustedRootJSON` assignment (the `if err == nil` swallow), alongside the `req.BaseImage.TrustedRootPath` assignment it should have shared a read with.

**Fix:** one read, in the composition root, feeding both consumers from the same bytes; an unreadable file now returns an error wrapping `core.ErrBaseSignatureInvalid` before the build starts. `ports.BaseImageRequest.TrustedRootJSON` takes bytes, so no adapter reads the file at all and all three Sigstore trust-root consumers finally have the same shape. `verifyKey` now keys on a fingerprint of the trusted-root *bytes* rather than the path they came from, so two different roots can no longer share a verification cache entry because they arrived from the same filename. Fail-closed proven by reintroducing the `if err == nil` shape and watching all four new assertions fail.

**Preventative rule:** when one flag feeds several consumers, read it once and share the value — duplicated reads of one input drift in their error handling, and the drift lands in whichever copy nobody was looking at. More generally: an `if err == nil { assign }` around a security control's input is a fail-open written in the shape of a guard, because the un-assigned field then means "use the default" — the very thing the flag was set to override. Covered by `mem:self_review_checklist` row 41.

## 2026-08-19 — Making custom `--base` lock slots per-reference silently unhooked `pokkum base check` and `RecordScanResult`, which both identified a lockfile entry by preset alone

**Category:** boundary / cache-key granularity — widening a key's granularity without auditing every consumer that reconstructs that key from less information

**Root cause:** the fix for the shared-`"custom"`-slot bug (see the entry below) changed the lock key from `string(preset)` to `lockKeyFor(preset, ref)`. Two consumers reconstructed the key independently and could not follow: `Resolver.RecordScanResult` took only `(lockfilePath, preset, scan)` and so could no longer name a custom base's entry — it would have found nothing and returned `nil`, turning "records the scan, possibly against the wrong entry" into "records nothing at all", a silent downgrade with no error; and `cmd/pokkum/base.go`'s `runBaseCheck` did `core.ParseBaseImagePreset(name)` on each lockfile slot name and `continue`d on failure, so every `custom:<hash>` slot would have been skipped and custom bases would have vanished from `pokkum base check`'s output. Both were caught before shipping, by grepping every reader and writer of the lockfile rather than only the site being changed — but neither was caught by any test, because no test asserted that a custom base appears in `base check` at all.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/baseimage/resolver.go`'s `RecordScanResult`; `cmd/pokkum/base.go`'s `runBaseCheck` loop.

**Fix:** `ports.BaseImageResolver.RecordScanResult` now takes the raw `ref` alongside the preset and derives the reference through the same `effectiveRefFor` helper `Resolve` uses, so both compute an identical key. `lockfileutils` gained `CustomLockKeyPrefix` and `PresetNameForLockKey`, and `runBaseCheck` goes through the latter; the cross-package relationship between the prefix and the `custom` preset name is pinned by `TestLockKeyPrefixMatchesTheCustomPreset`, since a rename in either package would otherwise compile cleanly.

**Preventative rule:** when a key gains a component, every site that *reconstructs* that key is a caller-chain break even though none of them fail to compile — a function that takes `(preset)` and looks up a `(preset, ref)`-keyed store returns "not found" rather than a type error. Grep for every reader and writer of the keyed store, and specifically for any place that parses a key *back* into its components (a preset parse, a prefix strip, a regex), because a widened key silently stops parsing. Covered by `mem:self_review_checklist` row 42.

## 2026-08-19 — Go's default VCS stamping churned the embedded PID-1 binaries on every commit, partially undoing the Roadmap 3f timestamp fix, and the reproducibility check meant to catch it never varied the one thing that mattered

**Category:** determinism — build metadata leaking into content that's supposed to be content-addressed, and a reproducibility guard exercising the wrong axis

**Root cause:** the blob-freshness guard added earlier the same night (to close the "embedded binaries are gitignored and nothing verifies they match their source" gap) failed immediately after being committed — including for `pokkum-init`, which has zero dependencies under `internal/`, so no source change could possibly explain a mismatch. Decompressed byte *counts* matched exactly while the bytes differed, which ruled out a source change and pointed at metadata. `go version -m` confirmed it: `go build` stamps `vcs.revision`, `vcs.time`, and `vcs.modified` into every binary by default, so a binary built at one commit never byte-matches one built at the next, even from identical source, and a dirty tree differs from a clean one. This silently undermined a fix that had already landed the same week: `1675d4c` pinned the Bun/`pokkum-init`/`pokkum-static` layers' tar `ModTime` to a fixed `pinnedImmutableBinaryEpoch` specifically so their digests would stop churning per commit — but the supervisor and static-server layers *contain* these binaries, whose actual *content* kept changing every commit regardless of the timestamp fix, so those two layers kept churning anyway. `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` leaking into these same layers was the first instance of this failure class; VCS stamping is the second, independent instance, in the identical layers.

**Where:** the `Makefile`'s `supervisor` and `static-server` targets (missing `-buildvcs=false`); `internal/adapters/staticserver/blob_freshness_test.go`'s `pid1BuildFresh` (the guard's own rebuild, which needed the identical flag to compare like for like).

**Fix:** `-buildvcs=false` added to both embedded-binary `Makefile` targets — which `.goreleaser.yaml`'s before-hooks also invoke, so releases are covered — and to the guard's own build invocation. The main CLI build is deliberately left alone, since `pokkum version` *wants* real VCS stamping. Verified with `go version -m` reporting no VCS stamps post-fix, the guard passing, and the binaries' bytes now determined purely by source.

**Preventative rule:** the original reproducibility check missed this because it built twice and compared — which passes, because both builds shared one commit and one dirty/clean state, so nothing that actually varies between real builds was ever varied. Reproducibility across *commits* (or clean vs. dirty tree) was the property that mattered and was never the one tested. Any guard whose job is "prove this artifact is byte-stable" must vary the dimension that changes in real usage, not just repeat the identical invocation. Folded into `mem:self_review_checklist` row 31, which already covered a knob leaking into a content-invariant artifact — this is the same class, just from a toolchain default nobody explicitly threaded, and it revises row 31 to add the "vary the real axis" discipline for the guard itself rather than adding a sibling row.

## 2026-08-19 — Every custom `--base` reference shared one `pokkum.lock` slot, so resolving a second custom base could silently return the first one's image content

**Category:** boundary / cache-key granularity — a lock key derived from a category (the preset name) rather than the specific identity of what's cached

**Root cause:** implementing `--base`'s long-promised (but previously unreachable) support for a full custom image reference required looking at `internal/adapters/baseimage/resolver.go`'s lockfile keying, which turned out to already be broken: `lockKey = string(req.Preset)`. For `BaseImageDistroless`/`BaseImageChainguard`/`BaseImageDistrolessNode` this is fine, because the preset string already uniquely names one specific upstream image — which is exactly why `distroless-node` was made its own preset (`f5229c3`) instead of a `Ref` override on `distroless`. `BaseImageCustom` breaks that invariant: it is one preset value covering *every* possible custom reference a project might use, so every custom base in a project shared the single literal `"custom"` lockfile slot regardless of which `Ref` each one actually named. The consequence was worse than an evicted cache entry: resolving custom base B after custom base A had already been locked found A's entry under the shared key, trusted its `PinnedRef`, and silently resolved and returned **A's image content for a B request** — a wrong answer served with no error, not a cache miss. It had been latent and unreachable in practice for the codebase's entire prior history purely because no CLI path could supply a custom reference at all until this same change added one; reproduced directly with two genuinely different images in a real registry, confirmed by stashing only the fix and watching B resolve to A's digest.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/baseimage/resolver.go`'s `Resolve`, the `lockKey := string(req.Preset)` line and both of its `lockfileutils.GetLockedBase(lf, lockKey)` call sites.

**Fix:** narrow, not a redesign. A `"custom"`-keyed entry is now only trusted when its recorded `Ref` matches the `Ref` actually being resolved (rejecting the false match instead of trusting a stale one), and — separately — its scan metadata (`LastScannedAt`/`VulnerabilitiesCount`/`MaxSeverity`) and mirror ref carry forward only when the entry's `Digest` also matches the digest just pulled. No `pokkum.lock` schema change, so no migration was needed for this fix. The proper fix — giving each custom reference its own lock slot, e.g. `"custom:" + sha256(ref)[:12]`, the same shape `distroless-node` already models and what `docs/archive/Roadmap.md` Tier 2 separately notes for a future `chainguard-static` preset — changes the lock-keying scheme and needs a migration story, so it's recorded as follow-up work rather than rushed into this change.

**Preventative rule:** added as `mem:self_review_checklist` row 38. A cache/lock key derived from a *category* (a preset name, a mode string) rather than the *specific identity* of the thing being cached must be checked for whether two logically distinct inputs can collapse onto the same category value — and if they can, a second request under that shared key doesn't just miss the cache, it can be silently handed the *first* request's content under the second request's name. Nothing signals this as a failure from the outside: the lookup succeeds, and the wrong data satisfies every caller that only checks "was something found."

## 2026-08-19 — `cosign verify-attestation` rejected every Pokkum attestation over a missing annotation whose value cosign itself never uses

**Category:** boundary — a third-party tool's interop contract assumed from a code comment, never checked against that tool's actual source

**Root cause:** running `paranoid-testing-guide.md`'s §8 against a real registry with real cosign v3.1.3 produced `no matching attestations: ... missing "dev.cosignproject.cosign/signature" annotation` for every Pokkum-produced attestation, even though `pokkum verify` read the identical material correctly — an interop gap in the tag-fallback attachment layout, not a broken signature. `internal/adapters/registry/attestation.go`'s `attestationImage()` omitted the `dev.cosignproject.cosign/signature` annotation entirely, on the assumption (encoded only in a comment, never checked against cosign's own code) that it was signature-only and meaningless for an attestation. Reading cosign v3's actual source told a different story: `VerifyImageAttestation` calls `static.Copy(att)` *before* the DSSE envelope is ever inspected, and that unconditionally calls `Base64Signature()`, which errors on the annotation *key* being absent — not on its value being empty or meaningless. Cosign's own attestation-push path (`pkg/oci/static/signature.go`) always writes that exact key with an empty string for attestations, with its own source comment stating it's a no-op for that case. `signatureImage()` (the plain-signature path) had always set the annotation correctly; only the attestation path had quietly diverged from it.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/attestation.go`'s `attestationImage()`.

**Fix:** attach the attestation layer with `dev.cosignproject.cosign/signature: ""`, matching cosign's own convention exactly rather than omitting the key. The media type was already correct and was never the actual problem. Proven against the real tool, not a unit test asserting the key merely exists: a local registry, a real ECDSA key, and a real DSSE envelope reproduced the exact failure before the fix and verified cleanly after, for both the manifest digest and the index digest (dual-publish coverage), with the plain-signature path and Pokkum's own `FetchAttestation`/`FetchSignature` read path both confirmed unaffected.

**Preventative rule:** added as `mem:self_review_checklist` row 36. An assumption about what a third-party consumer's wire format requires or tolerates, if it's only written down in a comment, must be checked against that consumer's actual source or published spec before shipping — not inferred from the error message it happens to produce, which can name the wrong cause (here, "missing" read as "the value doesn't matter" when the actual defect was the key being absent at all). This is the mirror of the existing row 16 discipline (verifying a feature's *own* claims against its own code): row 16 asks whether your code does what you say; this row asks whether what you hand to someone else's code satisfies what *their* code actually checks.

## 2026-08-19 — `pokkum-static` computed and sent a strong `ETag` on every response but had no `If-None-Match` handling anywhere, so it never answered 304 and always resent the full body

**Category:** feature reality check — a validator advertised and computed but never consulted on the request side

**Root cause:** found by executing, not reading, `paranoid-testing-guide.md`'s static-strategy section — the guide told the reader to verify a 304 on a repeat request, and the real server answered 200 every single time. A grep of the whole `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-static` package's non-test code turned up zero references to `If-None-Match`, `IfNoneMatch`, `StatusNotModified`, or `304` anywhere — the server used its computed `ETag` only for `If-Range` validation on ranged requests, never for a plain conditional GET. This mattered most for prerendered HTML, which `cachePolicy` deliberately marks `no-cache` (so it's revalidated on literally every request) — exactly the case 304 exists to make cheap, and instead every single load re-sent the full body.

**Where:** `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-static/server.go` — no conditional-GET path existed at all before this fix.

**Fix:** implemented per RFC 9110: `If-None-Match` is parsed as a list of entity-tags, a bare `*` matches any existing representation, and comparison is weak (the server only ever emits strong tags, so only the request side needs the weak-prefix tolerance). The check runs after the `ETag` is computed and set, and before the `Range` handling block, so a matching conditional returns 304 rather than 206 as the spec requires — placed after path resolution/containment, so it cannot short-circuit ahead of the traversal defenses. `If-Modified-Since` was deliberately left unimplemented: no `Last-Modified` is sent today, and in-image mtimes are pinned to a fixed epoch for reproducibility, so a mtime-derived validator would be *constant* across every build — worse than absent, since two genuinely different builds would look identical to a client. Nine new tests cover matching/non-matching/`*`/comma-lists/the weak prefix/conditional-beats-Range/HEAD parity, asserting the *absence* of a body on 304 rather than only the status code; the embedded blob was regenerated and the exact shipped binary verified in a real linux/amd64 container, not just a source-equivalent rebuild.

**Preventative rule:** a header a server computes and *sends* (an `ETag`, a capability indicator) is not evidence the corresponding *request-side* handling exists — check both directions independently. This particular gap was found only by executing the documentation that claimed to test it, not by reading the server's code with the claim in mind; see the adjacent "guide's own premise was wrong" entry below for the sibling lesson from the same pass. Added as `mem:self_review_checklist` row 37: executing a guide's literal commands against the real system is itself a test, and finds bugs that re-reading the guide for internal consistency cannot.

## 2026-08-19 — `paranoid-testing-guide.md`'s own `--output=json` premise was wrong in eight places, and it was internally consistent the whole time

**Category:** multi-item / test-substance — a document whose own claim about the system was false, reused across every downstream step that depended on it

**Root cause:** while executing the guide live (rather than reading it) to rewrite it against what the code actually does, every `jq -r '.data.digest'`-style extraction following a `pokkum build --output=json` failed, because `build`'s stdout is unconditionally the plain `repo@sha256:...` image reference — `internal/core/pipeline.go`'s Stage 11 states explicitly that this is deliberate: it's "the one line of program output," meant to be piped straight into `kubectl set image` or a manifest rewrite, and nothing else may ever share that stream. `--print-manifest`'s JSON output separately has no `.data` wrapper either — the JSON envelope convention is per-command, not universal across the CLI. The guide's `jq` extraction pattern was written once and then reused in eight separate places, so the same wrong premise broke every downstream step that depended on a digest it never actually got.

**Where:** `paranoid-testing-guide.md` (documentation only; not a product defect — `internal/core/pipeline.go`'s Stage 11 comment already stated the real contract explicitly).

**Fix:** corrected at the root (the guide's stated premise about `--output=json`) and in all eight downstream uses, rather than patching each `jq` call independently and leaving the false premise itself uncorrected.

**Preventative rule:** a document can be entirely internally consistent — each step following logically from the last — and still be entirely wrong about what the underlying system does, because internal consistency only re-derives the author's own mental model rather than checking it against reality. This is precisely the failure mode the guide's own "believe nothing, verify independently" premise exists to catch, turned back on itself: the fix came from actually running the commands, not from a closer reading of the prose. Added as `mem:self_review_checklist` row 37 (shared with the adjacent `ETag`/`If-None-Match` entry above, found in the same executed-guide pass): running a guide's literal commands against the real, current binary is itself a test.

## 2026-08-19 — Real-build tests wrote into `testdata/fixtures/*` in place, leaving order-dependent state (`build/`, `.svelte-kit/`, `.pokkum/`, `pokkum.lock`) other tests and runs then inherited

**Category:** multi-item / shared-mutable-state — a fixture directory treated as read-only input by test *authors* while several tests actually wrote into it

**Root cause:** `tests/integration/runtime_smoke_test.go` already established the correct pattern (copy the fixture into `t.TempDir()`, symlink `node_modules` back, build in the copy) but it was never generalized: `TestFixtureDrivenE2E_Static`/`_SPAFallback` and `TestFixtureDrivenE2E_AllStrategies` (mock `Compiler`s that write `build/` and `.svelte-kit/output` directly under `ProjectDir`), `TestRealBuildIsReproducibleAcrossRuns` and `TestRealBuild_StrategyLayered_PrerenderedRoute` (the real `bunexec.Compiler`, which runs `bun run build`/`bun build --compile` with `cwd` set to `ProjectDir`), and `internal/adapters/bunexec/integration_test.go`'s `TestLiveFixture_PreflightAndCompile` (the real compiler again, deliberately skipping `Prepare` specifically because the fixture "may be shared with, or already prepared by, other tooling" — a comment that named the hazard without eliminating it) all passed `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-basic` or `.../sveltekit-adapter-node` straight through as `ProjectDir`. Three separate incidents already existed from this before this pass: `TestLiveFixture_PreflightAndCompile` failing once in a full-suite run then passing 3/3 in isolation (mechanism plausible — a real build's `cwd` sitting in a directory concurrently readable/writable by other test binaries — never confirmed as root cause, and that honesty is kept here deliberately); the static-strategy mock colliding with its own prior run's flattened output (fixed ad hoc with an `os.RemoveAll` reset, addressed structurally by this pass); and `runtime_smoke_test.go`'s own existing isolation, added specifically because a real `BaseImageResolver` writes `pokkum.lock` next to `ProjectDir`. Separately, 27 generated `.pokkum/handler-*.js` artifacts had accumulated and been committed under `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node/` (fixed in commit `e5dd73c` by gitignoring `testdata/fixtures/*/.pokkum/`) — evidence of the identical root cause reaching version control, not just the working tree.

**Where:** `tests/integration/static_e2e_test.go` (`TestFixtureDrivenE2E_Static`, `TestFixtureDrivenE2E_Static_SPAFallback`), `tests/integration/strategy_e2e_test.go` (`TestFixtureDrivenE2E_AllStrategies`), `tests/integration/reproducibility_e2e_test.go` (`TestRealBuildIsReproducibleAcrossRuns`), `tests/integration/layered_prerendered_e2e_test.go` (`TestRealBuild_StrategyLayered_PrerenderedRoute`), `internal/adapters/bunexec/integration_test.go` (`TestLiveFixture_PreflightAndCompile`).

**Fix:** `tests/integration/runtime_smoke_test.go`'s `copyFixtureProject`/`skipDirNames` moved to `harness_test.go` (the package's designated shared-helper file, same `package integration`, no new import path needed) and is now called by all five `tests/integration` tests above before they set `ProjectDir`. `internal/adapters/bunexec` cannot import a helper from `tests/integration` (a separate package with no shared test-helper import path, and adapter→adapter imports are architecturally forbidden regardless), so it got a small, deliberately duplicated `copyLiveFixtureProject` local to `integration_test.go` — with one real difference from `tests/integration`'s version: it does NOT skip `.svelte-kit`, because `TestLiveFixture_PreflightAndCompile`'s entire precondition is that the source fixture has already been prepared, so the copy must carry that pre-generated state forward rather than start fresh. Tests that only *read* a fixture (SBOM generation off `bun.lock`/`package.json`, or any `StrategyExe` test using the shared `mockCompiler`, whose `Prepare` only computes path strings and creates nothing on disk for that strategy) were left untouched after confirming, by reading the actual production code, that nothing in their dependency chain (`sbom.Generator`, `packager.Packager`, `mockCompiler`'s `StrategyExe` branch, `mockBaseResolver.RecordScanResult`) ever calls `os.WriteFile`/`os.MkdirAll` against `ProjectDir` — "would running this against the checked-out fixture actually write anything" was checked directly, not inferred from the test passing.

**Preventative rule:** a fixture directory shared across tests/packages is never read-only by convention alone — any test that threads it into a real compiler, a mock that writes fixture files, or a real `BaseImageResolver`/lockfile writer must copy it into `t.TempDir()` first (symlinking `node_modules` rather than copying, to keep the large-dependency-tree case fast) and use the copy as `ProjectDir`. When one test in a package already has this pattern, check every other test in the same package (and every same-named fixture used by a different package) for the same shape before treating the fixture as safe — a documented awareness of the hazard (as `TestLiveFixture_PreflightAndCompile`'s own comment had) is not the same as having fixed it. This closes the same gap `mem:self_review_checklist` is meant to catch on every future real-build test added to this codebase.

## 2026-08-18 — `--expect-source` verified against the artifact's own unsigned annotations

**Category:** fail-open / self-referential-check
**Root cause:** `PinnedInputs.Repo`/`Commit` were seeded from the image's own `org.opencontainers.image.source`/`.revision` OCI annotations and only *overwritten* when a verified SLSA statement happened to carry a `source-code` dependency. `validateSourceMatch` then ran against whichever source had won, with no record of which one that was. So on any image without verified provenance, `--expect-source` compared two attacker-controlled strings and reported match/mismatch as though it had verified something. Same family as the keyless-identity bug logged above: the expected value came from the material under inspection.
**Where:** `internal/adapters/provenance/resolver.go` (annotation seeding, `populateInputsFromSLSA`, `validateSourceMatch`); `internal/core/pipeline.go`'s SLSA request construction.
**Fix:** Values now carry their origin (`ports.SourceProvenance`: none / unverified / verified). `--expect-source` refuses to run unless the source is verified, with `--allow-unverified-source` as an opt-in hatch that still compares but stamps the result unverified in both text and JSON output. Required a prerequisite fix: `slsa.Generate` supported `GitRepo`/`GitCommit` and the resolver read `source-code`, but `pipeline.go` never passed them, so no production statement carried source info — gating alone would have made the flag fail for every image forever. Git discovery was added in the generator rather than reusing the existing OCI-label path, because labels are user-overridable via `--image-label` and cannot be the source of truth for a signed statement.
**Preventative rule:** Before gating a check on "verified" data, confirm something in production actually *produces* that data — a supported request field plus a reader for it is not a working pipeline (checklist row 16). And when a security control tightens, check whether the tightening makes it unusable rather than merely stricter: a control that always fails gets disabled by its users, which is worse than the gap it closed.

## 2026-08-18 — Image signing was wired end-to-end for the first time; every image Pokkum ever pushed before this was unsigned, despite `--sign` defaulting to true and README advertising an SLSA-3 badge

**Category:** overclaiming / fake-implementation — a direct recurrence of the class already logged at this file's 2026-08-17 "Four shipped, `[x]`-marked, documented features were stubs" entry, not a new failure mode

**Root cause:** `--sign` defaulted to `true`, `BuildRequest.Validate` *required* non-nil `CosignSigner`/`DSSESigner` at construction, and the pipeline's signing stage generated a real SLSA statement — but then only logged it and discarded it. Neither signer's `Sign()` method was ever called anywhere in `internal/core/pipeline.go`. `ports.Registry` had no method to attach a signature or attestation to a pushed image at all, and no code path could supply a signing key: `POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY` had zero references anywhere in the codebase before this session. Every build that ran to completion pushed a completely unsigned image while `README.md` carried an SLSA-3 badge and the phrase "signed provenance, on by default." Two further consequences fell out of the identical root cause, silently: `pokkum verify` could never validate one of Pokkum's own images (nothing to fetch), and the remote build cache was dead by default, because cache-hit verification requires a `.sig` that nothing had ever produced — every cache check was a guaranteed miss.

This is the exact class of bug logged in this file's 2026-08-17 entry "Four shipped, `[x]`-marked, documented features were stubs or half-built" (around this file's line ~118): a feature described in docs and gated by real-looking validation code, with no test ever asserting the one thing that would have caught it — that the signer's `Sign()` method is actually invoked. That entry's own preventative rule — "grep the implementing file for the I/O the feature necessarily requires... a command that claims to inspect a remote image must reference `remote.`/`Fetch`/a tar reader somewhere" — would have caught this in one command: grepping `internal/core/pipeline.go` for `CosignSigner.Sign(` or `DSSESigner.Sign(` before this fix returns zero matches, despite both being required, non-nil dependencies of every build. **This is the most important lesson in this entry**: the checklist row that exists specifically to catch this exact failure mode was not run against this exact code before now, even though the row itself, and the almost-identical prior incident, both already existed in this project's own memory.

**Where:** `internal/core/pipeline.go` (the signing block that generated-logged-discarded the SLSA statement); `internal/ports/registry.go` (no `AttachAttestation`/`AttachSignature` method existed on `Registry` at all).

**Fix:** `ports.Registry` gained `AttachSignature`/`AttachAttestation`/`FetchSignature`/`FetchAttestation`, mirroring `AttachSBOM`'s OCI 1.1 referrer-with-tag-fallback path. `core.signAndSelfVerify` now signs each subject digest with Cosign, DSSE-signs the SLSA statement, attaches both, dual-publishes to the index and every per-platform manifest, and then — critically — fetches the material back from the registry and cryptographically re-verifies it before reporting the build as signed, so a broken attach path can never silently report success (see the "control whose absence is indistinguishable from success" entry logged separately below, from the same review). A signing key is now real: `--signing-key`/`POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY` (PEM text or a file path; ECDSA P-256 or Ed25519), with `--require-signed` turning a missing key into a hard build failure instead of the default behavior, which is to push unsigned with a loud, unmissable warning and record that fact in `BuildResult.Signing` rather than ever claiming to have signed.

**Preventative rule:** unchanged from the prior incident, restated because it was not applied: before marking any signing/attestation/verification feature complete, grep the exact function that is supposed to perform the cryptographic operation for a call to the signer/verifier's actual method. A required, non-nil dependency injected into validation is not evidence it is ever invoked — validation and use are two different lines of code, and this bug is proof that a codebase can enforce the former while never doing the latter. `mem:self_review_checklist` row 16 is sharpened (not replaced) by this incident to name this specific shape explicitly: a signer/verifier that is constructed, validated as present, and then never called reads identical, from the outside, to one that works — see also the new checklist rows on self-referential verification and self-verifying controls, logged in the same session.

## 2026-08-18 — Keyless Sigstore verification derived its expected signer identity from the certificate it was verifying, so it was dead code that failed identically for genuine and forged signatures — and the obvious fix would have made it worse than the bug

**Category:** self-referential security check (new category)

**Root cause:** `pokkum verify`'s keyless verification path read the expected signer identity out of the very X.509 certificate under verification — specifically `Issuer.CommonName`, which is the certificate authority's own distinguished name (`"sigstore-intermediate"` for every Fulcio-issued certificate on earth), not the signer's identity. `sigstore-go` itself matches identity against a completely different field: the OIDC issuer X.509 extension (OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1`, e.g. `"https://accounts.google.com"`). Because the code compared a constant CA name against itself in every real case, the comparison could never succeed — confirmed against this repo's own real Fulcio certificate fixture with `openssl x509 -text` and an empirical probe. The keyless path was consequently dead code: it failed the same way for a legitimate signature and a forged one, meaning it provided exactly zero security value while looking, from a test asserting only pass/fail shape, like a working check.

The trap here is not just "wrong field" — it is that the *naive* fix is actively worse than the bug it fixes. Reading the real OIDC issuer extension out of the certificate and comparing it against itself (rather than against `Issuer.CommonName`) makes the check tautological: every certificate Fulcio has ever issued to anyone with a GitHub or Google account carries a real, self-consistent OIDC issuer extension, so that version of the fix would accept any Fulcio-issued signature on the planet as valid. This walks straight past a deliberate empty-identity refusal already present in `internal/adapters/sigstore/verifier.go`, which exists precisely because any Fulcio certificate is trivially obtainable by anyone with a free identity provider account — the whole point of keyless verification is that the *caller* names who they expect to have signed, not that the artifact tells the verifier who to trust.

**Where:** `pokkum verify`'s provenance resolution path (`internal/adapters/provenance/resolver.go`), reading `Issuer.CommonName` off the certificate under verification.

**Fix:** the expected identity now comes exclusively from the operator, never from the artifact: new `ports.ProvenanceResolverRequest` fields `KeylessIdentity` (SAN + issuer), `PublicKeyPEM`, and `TrustedRootJSON`; new `pokkum verify` flags `--keyless-identity`/`--keyless-issuer`/`--public-key`/`--sigstore-trusted-root`. Keyless material present on the image with no configured identity is now a hard, named error before any network I/O runs, not a silent pass — refusing to verify against an unconstrained identity, exactly as `sigstore/verifier.go`'s existing refusal already required for the base-image path. A half-configured identity (one flag but not its pair) also fails immediately rather than merging in a default for the missing half. Three further fail-open siblings in the same code path were fixed alongside it: `checkSimpleSigningClaims` was missing the `Critical.Type` check its sibling copies have and skipped repo/digest comparison entirely when the expectation was empty; `--expect-source` matched with `strings.Contains` (so `evil/github.com/acme/app` satisfied an expectation of `github.com/acme/app`); and SLSA subject matching used `Contains(sub.URI, digest.Hex)`, so an attestation on an attacker-controlled, all-hex-named repository could match a victim's digest by substring alone.

**Preventative rule:** a security check's expected value must always originate from somewhere outside the artifact being checked — a flag, a config file, an explicitly-chosen default tied to a known publisher — never derived from a field on the certificate, signature, or payload the check exists to validate, no matter how plausible-looking the field is. When fixing a check like this, the fix itself must be checked for the same defect one level up: verify that comparing the corrected field against *itself* (not against an operator-supplied expectation) would not make the check trivially satisfiable by anything the artifact carries. Logged in `mem:self_review_checklist` as a new row.

## 2026-08-18 — secretguard's post-build scan silently reported a clean directory it had never actually looked at, on the exact minified bundles it most needed to cover

**Category:** resource-limit-vs-realistic-input / multi-item (a bufio.Scanner token-limit bug plus a one-match-per-line bug, found together while extending secretguard to scan build output)

**Root cause (bug 1 — silent false-clean on any minified line):** `secretguard`'s file scanner used `bufio.Scanner`, whose default token (line) buffer is capped at 64KB. Any single minified/bundled JavaScript or CSS line — which a real SvelteKit build output routinely produces, since a bundler's whole point is emitting as few, as long, lines as possible — reliably exceeds that limit and produces `bufio.ErrTooLong`. The caller, `ScanDirectory`, treated *any* `scanFile` error identically: log and skip. That silently discarded every match already found in that file and reported the whole directory clean, with no distinction between "scanned this file and found nothing" and "gave up partway through and never actually saw most of it." Because the guard ran only against pre-build source at the time this bug was introduced, and hand-written source rarely produces 64KB single lines, nothing exercised this path — it was inert until this session's fix extended scanning to cover the built output (Vite/Rollup bundles), which is exactly where 64KB+ single lines are the norm rather than the exception.

**Root cause (bug 2 — one match per line, hiding every secret after the first):** independently, the regex matching itself used `FindStringIndex` plus a `break` after the first match per rule per line. On an ordinary multi-line source file this rarely matters. On a minified bundle, where an entire file is frequently one line, this meant at most one secret could ever be reported per file, however many were actually present — every secret after the first on that line was silently invisible to the scanner regardless of whether bug 1's size limit was even hit.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/secretguard/guard.go`'s per-file scan loop (`bufio.Scanner` usage) and its per-rule match loop (`FindStringIndex`/`break`).

**Fix:** scanning no longer uses `bufio.Scanner` at all (replaced with a full-file read up to a configurable ceiling, default raised 2MB → 16MB specifically to cover real bundled chunks, with a cheap 512-byte NUL-sniff to skip binary content regardless of size). A file that cannot be scanned — too large, unreadable — is now recorded as a `ports.SecretSkip` and fails the build via the new `core.ErrSecretScanIncomplete` sentinel, distinct from `ErrSecretInlined`: "I could not look at this file" is now reported differently from "I looked and found nothing," and a non-empty skip list always forces `Passed=false`. Matching switched from `FindStringIndex`+`break` to `FindAllStringIndex` per rule, so every match on a line is reported, not just the first. Verified against this repo's own real built `adapter-node` fixture output: zero false positives at the new ceiling.

**Preventative rule:** any text-scanning code bounded by a fixed token/line/buffer-size constant (`bufio.Scanner`'s 64KB default is the most common trap in Go specifically) needs a test that actually exercises the constant's boundary against *realistic generated input* — a real minified bundle, not hand-written test fixtures, which structurally cannot produce the pathological single-line-file shape that triggers this class of bug. A caller that treats "the scan step reported an error" identically to "the scan step found nothing" converts every such limit into a silent false-negative; these must be distinguished at the type level (a skip list, a distinct sentinel error), not just logged and swallowed. Logged in `mem:self_review_checklist` as a new row.

## 2026-08-18 — The CVE gate's version comparison was byte-wise lexicographic, so `1.2.0 < 1.10.0` evaluated to false

**Category:** validation logic / security-gate correctness — found by a fuzz target added earlier the same day and left skip-guarded until this fix

**Root cause:** `isVersionOlderThan` compared two version strings with Go's native `<` operator — an ordinary byte-wise lexicographic string comparison, not a numeric one. This is wrong for the near-universal case of a version segment that reaches two digits: `"1.2.0" < "1.10.0"` is `false` under lexicographic comparison (`'2' > '1'` at the first differing byte), when the numerically correct answer is `true`. The same defect affects `1.9.0`/`1.10.0`, `2.9.0`/`2.10.0`, and any semver pre-release suffix ordering (`1.2.0-beta` vs `1.2.0`). This function gates the offline embedded-advisory CVE path used by `pokkum scan --offline`/`--toolchain` fallback (the live OSV.dev query path evaluates version ranges server-side and was never affected). At the time this bug was introduced, every embedded `FixedVersion` happened to be single-digit, so the live production effect was occasional false positives, not a bypass — but the exact same defect becomes a real `--fail-on-cve` bypass, silently, the moment any embedded `FixedVersion` reaches two digits in any segment, which requires no code change to trigger, only time.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/scanner/adapter.go`'s `isVersionOlderThan`.

**Fix:** replaced with `compareVersions`, a dot-segment-wise numeric comparator that pads missing trailing segments as zero, splits a trailing `-suffix` (semver pre-release or distro build revision) from the numeric core before comparing, and — this is the security-relevant design choice — resolves every genuinely unorderable case (a non-numeric segment, two differently-suffixed builds of the same numeric core) in the fail-safe direction: "older / still vulnerable," never "newer / patched." On a CVE gate, a false positive costs a human a few seconds re-reading a report; a false negative defeats the exact check it's implementing, so an inability to determine an ordering must never resolve toward "safe." The pre-existing fuzz target for this function (added earlier the same day, skip-guarded pending this fix) is now unskipped and passes ~1.05M real executions. Fixing the comparator also surfaced that the scanner's package.json-fallback placeholder version (`"2.15.0"`) had only ever appeared vulnerable *because* of this exact lexicographic bug — corrected to a placeholder (`"2.2.0"`) that is genuinely, numerically older than the embedded advisory's fixed version, so the fallback path continues to exercise a real finding on its own merits rather than by accident.

**Preventative rule:** never compare version strings with a native `<`/`>`/`==` operator or `strings.Compare` — version numbers are not lexicographically ordered data, and every codebase that does this eventually hits a two-digit segment. Any comparison feeding a security gate must additionally choose an explicit, documented resolution direction for the unorderable case, and that direction must be the conservative one for what the gate protects (here: still-vulnerable), not an incidental byte-wise fallback whose result carries no real meaning.

## 2026-08-18 — Bun's SHASUMS parser validated a checksum's length but not its character set, so 64 literal `g` characters parsed as a valid SHA-256 digest

**Category:** validation logic (length-without-charset) — a new bug found by the same day's fuzz seed corpus, left skip-guarded until this fix

**Root cause:** `parseSHASUMSEntry` checked that a checksum field was exactly 64 characters long — the correct length for a hex-encoded SHA-256 digest — but never checked that those 64 characters were actually hexadecimal. A string of 64 `'g'` characters (not a valid hex digit) satisfied the length check and was accepted as a well-formed digest. This is a real contract violation on the Bun runtime integrity path regardless of whether it was exploitable in production: it was masked there only because the caller string-compares the parsed value against a real, freshly-computed hex digest, so a malformed-but-length-correct entry surfaces as an ordinary mismatch (rejected) rather than a bypass (accepted) — masked by a downstream check, not fixed by this code.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunruntime/resolver.go`'s `parseSHASUMSEntry`.

**Fix:** added an `isHexDigest` helper — mirroring the equivalent, already-existing helper in `pokkum-init`'s attestation code (`supervisor/cmd/pokkum-init/attest.go`) rather than introducing a third independent implementation — and validates every checksum against it after the length check. The corresponding fuzz target (added earlier the same day, skip-guarded pending this fix) is now unskipped and passes ~805K real executions, with a regression corpus entry checked in.

**Preventative rule:** validating a fixed-length token (a hash, a digest, an ID expected to be hex/base64/etc.) by length alone is validating half the contract. Any code that parses such a token from untrusted or semi-trusted input (a downloaded manifest, an external API response) must check both length AND character set before treating it as well-formed — and when a downstream string-comparison happens to mask the gap in the current call path, that is worth noting explicitly as "masked, not fixed," because a future caller that only checks `err == nil` rather than doing its own byte-for-byte comparison would not be protected the same way.

## 2026-08-18 — PR-5's real fix found two more real bugs the moment it was actually compiled and run — including a fundamental, previously-unknown Bun/OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation incompatibility

**Category:** verify-before-shipping (row 17 family) — both bugs were caught by actually running `bun build --compile` + the resulting binary against a real fake OTLP collector, not by reading generated code or unit-testing string output

**Root cause, bug 1 (trivial but would have broken every telemetry-enabled build):** the pre-existing `GenerateInstrumentationServer` (dead code until this session's fix wired it up) imported `TraceIDRatioBasedSampler` and `ALWAYS_OFF` from `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base` — neither export exists; the real names are `TraceIdRatioBasedSampler` (lowercase "d") and a class `AlwaysOffSampler` that must be instantiated (`new AlwaysOffSampler()`), not a constant. This had zero test coverage that would ever catch it: the existing unit test only asserted the generated TEXT contained the string `"ALWAYS_OFF"`, which passed regardless of whether that string named something real. Caught immediately on the first real `bun build --compile` attempt against real installed `@opentelemetry/*` packages.

**Root cause, bug 2 (the significant one — a real, current ecosystem incompatibility, not a Pokkum bug):** `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`'s `getNodeAutoInstrumentations()` — the entire premise of "auto-instrumentation" that PR-5's original design and the pre-existing dead code both assumed — works by patching Node's module loader (`require-in-the-middle`/`import-in-the-middle`) to intercept calls to instrumented modules (`node:http`, database clients, etc.). That patching does not take effect under Bun's runtime. Verified with escalating rigor, not assumed after one failed attempt: (1) a real HTTP server + client round trip through `node:http`, compiled and run, produced zero spans; (2) reasoned this might be an import-hook *registration-order* bug (ES module hoisting means all static imports in a file resolve before that file's own top-level code runs, so a `register()` call after several `@opentelemetry/*` imports could register too late if those imports themselves already loaded `node:http`) and retested with the hook registered via `bun run --preload` — genuinely as early as technically possible, before *any* instrumented module could have been cached — still zero spans, ruling out ordering as the cause; (3) confirmed the SDK/exporter pipeline itself was not the problem by manually creating a span with `tracer.startSpan()`/`.end()` (no auto-instrumentation involved) and watching it successfully reach a real fake OTLP collector. This isolates the failure precisely to auto-instrumentation's require/import-hook mechanism specifically, under Bun specifically — a real, current gap in Bun's Node.js compatibility, not fixable by anything in Pokkum's generated bootstrap.

**Root cause, bug 3 (found while removing bug 2's dead weight):** combining `@opentelemetry/exporter-metrics-otlp-proto`'s `OTLPMetricExporter` with `NodeSDK` in the same `bun build --compile` binary crashes at runtime — `TypeError: Cannot call a class constructor OTLPExporterNodeBase without |new|`, with the stack trace showing bundler-generated symbol names suffixed `2` (`OTLPMetricExporterNodeProxy2`, `OTLPMetricExporter2`), i.e. Bun's bundler produced two non-interoperable copies of the shared `otlp-exporter-base` module inside one compiled binary, and one copy's `class extends` resolved against the *other* copy's base class. Reproduced with a minimal 6-line repro (`NodeSDK` + `OTLPMetricExporter`, no trace exporter at all) to confirm it wasn't a trace/metrics interaction — the metrics exporter alone, combined with `NodeSDK`, is suffient to trigger it. A real Bun bundler bug, not a Pokkum bug.

**Root cause, bug 4 (found during self-review, not by a test or a user — a negative check where a positive check was needed):** the initial wiring in `bunexec.Compiler.Prepare` gated telemetry entrypoint-wrapping with `if req.Telemetry.Enabled && !req.Strategy.ApplyStatic()` — a *negative* check ("anything that isn't static") that silently included `ports.StrategyLayered`, Pokkum's *default* strategy. The wrapper file (`.pokkum/telemetry-entry.ts`) was generated correctly, but nothing downstream of `StrategyLayered` ever reads `CompileRequest.EntrypointPath` — only `Compile()` does, and `pipeline.go` only calls `Compile()` for `StrategyExe`; `StrategyLayered` packages `prep.OutputDir` directly and execs a hardcoded `/pokkum/init -- /usr/local/bin/bun /app/server/index.js` via `ports.DefaultLayeredEntrypoint()`. Net effect: for the strategy most users actually run, `--telemetry` would have silently done nothing — no error, no warning, a real-looking `.pokkum/telemetry-entry.ts` sitting unused on disk. Caught by mechanically running `mem:self_review_checklist` row 11 ("strategy-gated logic scoped to the right strategy... a negative check is not the same as a positive check") against this diff's actual lines, not by any test — no test exercised `StrategyLayered` with telemetry enabled until this bug was found and one was written.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/telemetry.go`'s `GenerateInstrumentationServer` (bugs 1–3); `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Prepare()` telemetry-wiring gate (bug 4; the function's own doc comment now documents the investigation in detail so a future session doesn't have to re-derive it).

**Fix:** corrected the two wrong export names; removed `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node` and the `import-in-the-middle` hook registration entirely from the generated bootstrap (no code fix exists for a runtime limitation); removed metrics export entirely and made the generated code emit an honest runtime `console.error` warning when `--metrics-only` is set, rather than silently doing nothing or leaving the crash in place. The real, working deliverable is narrower than "OTel auto-instrumentation" — a real SDK bootstrap plus a documented, user-added `hooks.server.ts` snippet (stable `@opentelemetry/api`, no experimental flags, no Bun incompatibility) for actually creating spans, since manual creation was the one thing confirmed to work end-to-end. Bug 4's fix: replaced the negative `!req.Strategy.ApplyStatic()` gate with a positive `switch req.Strategy { case ports.StrategyExe: ...wire the wrapper...; case ports.StrategyLayered: log.Warn(...) }`, so `StrategyLayered` now gets an explicit, visible warning instead of silent no-op behavior, and the feature is honestly scoped to `--strategy=exe` until `ports.DefaultLayeredEntrypoint()`'s argv construction and the packager are extended to support it (tracked as its own `docs/archive/Roadmap.md` backlog row, not silently folded into "PR-5 done"). See `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s PR-5 row and `Vocabulary.md` §3a for the user-facing framing of this scope.

**Preventative rule:** extends row 17 ("packaged/compiled output must actually execute, not just look right") to name the specific trap this incident hit twice in one function: generated code that imports third-party packages by name can be wrong in ways `strings.Contains` assertions on the generated text will never catch (bug 1 — the string `"ALWAYS_OFF"` appeared in the output whether or not it named a real export), and a whole category of JS runtime feature (require/import-hook-based monkeypatching) can be silently non-functional under a JS runtime Pokkum specifically targets (Bun) even though the exact same code works correctly under the runtime most such packages are developed/tested against (Node). When generated code imports a third-party package for a *mechanism* (not just a value), the only real verification is compiling and running it against the actual target runtime with the actual real dependency installed — a passing unit test on the generated text, or even a successful *compile*, proves nothing about whether the mechanism it invokes actually functions at runtime. Bug 4 separately reconfirms row 11 as a distinct, recurring failure mode from bugs 1–3: a feature can be wired with code that is individually correct (the wrapper-generation logic worked, the file was written correctly) yet still be a complete no-op for the strategy most users hit, because the *gating condition* deciding whether that correct code even runs was phrased as an exclusion instead of an inclusion. Negative gates (`!X.IsSomething()`) silently absorb every new/existing case that isn't explicitly excluded; positive gates (`switch X { case A: ...; case B: ... }`) force each case to be named and force the compiler/reviewer to notice an unhandled one.

## 2026-08-18 — `--hermetic`'s pathname-Unix-socket gap: researched a full fix, deliberately shipped a narrower one instead

**Category:** scoped-decision / no bug found — a design investigation, not a post-mortem, logged per this project's established convention of recording real technical reasoning behind a scope decision (see the 2026-08-17 PR-4 entry for the same pattern)

**Context:** PR-2's Linux network-namespace sandbox (`CLONE_NEWNET|CLONE_NEWUSER`) correctly blocks IP egress and abstract-namespace Unix sockets, but a security review had already flagged that filesystem-*path* Unix domain sockets (`/var/run/docker.sock` if bind-mounted, `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) remain reachable, since they're namespaced by the mount namespace, which `CLONE_NEWNS` deliberately isn't set for.

**What was investigated:** a background research agent read Go's actual `syscall/exec_linux.go` (via `$(go env GOROOT)/src/syscall/exec_linux.go` and `GOOS=linux go doc syscall.SysProcAttr`) to determine whether `syscall.SysProcAttr` alone could close this. Finding: it exposes `Cloneflags`, `Unshareflags`, a single `Chroot` path, uid/gid mappings, and nothing else — the runtime's own `forkAndExecInChild1` runs a fixed sequence (unshare → write uid/gid maps → optional single `chroot(2)` → setuid/setgid → chdir → `execve`) with **no hook for arbitrary code** (e.g. `mount`/`umount2` calls to mask specific sensitive paths) between the namespace unshare and the exec. An empty `CLONE_NEWNS` unshare by itself buys nothing — a new mount namespace starts as a *copy* of the parent's mount table, not an empty one; something must actively unmount/mask paths within it. The only way to run that masking code is a separate process step — a `/proc/self/exe` reexec helper (the real runc/Docker pattern: Pokkum re-invokes itself already inside the new namespaces via a hidden entrypoint, does raw `mount`/`umount2` calls to mask sensitive paths, then `syscall.Exec`s into the real `bun`).

**Decision: build the reexec helper was not attempted.** It is the *correct*, complete fix and matches how real container runtimes solve exactly this — but it is materially larger and riskier than PR-2's own fix: a new self-reexec code path in `main()`, new raw-syscall mount/unmount logic that must get bind-mount-vs-tmpfs semantics and ordering right across differing distro `/run` layouts, and new container-based tests, all to close a gap that needs a fairly specific precondition (`docker.sock` bind-mounted into Pokkum's own runtime, or an inherited SSH agent socket) to be exploitable at all. Getting the masking logic subtly wrong — e.g. masking a path a legitimate build actually needs under `/tmp` or a distro-specific `/run` subpath — risks turning "no network egress" into "builds silently break," a worse outcome than the current, honestly-documented gap.

**What shipped instead:** `stripHermeticSensitiveEnv` (`internal/adapters/bunexec/env.go`) removes `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`/`SSH_AGENT_PID`/`GPG_AGENT_INFO`/`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`/`DOCKER_HOST` from a hermetic build's subprocess environment. This is real, not cosmetic, for exactly the vectors it touches: `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is the *only* way ssh/git tooling locates the agent socket, so removing the env var fully closes that vector, with zero ambiguity. It provides **no protection at all** for `/var/run/docker.sock` specifically — that path is a filesystem convention (`test -S /var/run/docker.sock`) a malicious script can hardcode or probe directly, with no dependency on any environment variable an env-var strip could ever remove. This was stated plainly in `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`/`Vocabulary.md`/`docs/archive/Feature-list.md`/Serena `mem:core`, not implied as "the gap, closed" — the `docker.sock` half remains open and is tracked as its own backlog item.

**Preventative rule:** when a security review identifies a real residual gap and a full fix is judged disproportionate for the current session, the honest response is (a) ship whatever real, narrowly-scoped mitigation genuinely exists, stated precisely — exactly what it closes and what it explicitly doesn't — and (b) research and document the real fix's shape even when not building it, so the next session doesn't have to re-derive "is `SysProcAttr` alone enough" from scratch. A partial mitigation is legitimate engineering; a partial mitigation whose docs imply completeness is the exact "fake-looking fix" this project's stated values (`CLAUDE.md`'s Zero Fake Implementations) exist to prevent — the discipline is in the wording, not just the code.

## 2026-08-17 — PR-2's first cut of `--hermetic` network enforcement only sandboxed half the pipeline — Compile ran fully unsandboxed, a complete bypass

**Category:** security / incomplete-scope (new checklist row 18) — caught by an adversarial Opus security review requested proactively before declaring the feature done, not by a test failure or user report

**Root cause:** PR-2 implements real kernel-enforced network isolation for `--hermetic` via an unprivileged Linux network namespace (`CLONE_NEWNET|CLONE_NEWUSER`, see the new-that-day `hermetic_linux.go`). The first cut wired this into `bunexec.Compiler.Prepare` (`bun run build`/`bun x vite build`) only — the stage the roadmap's own line reference (`compiler.go:324`) pointed at. `Compiler.Compile` (`bun build --compile`, stage two) was left completely unsandboxed, with no `Hermetic` field on `ports.CompileRequest` at all. This is a full bypass, not a partial one: `bun build --compile` bundles `req.EntrypointPath` — a file the third-party SvelteKit adapter *generated during stage one* — and Bun's bundler executes `bunfig.toml` preload plugins and `with { type: "macro" }` imports at bundle time, so a malicious build-time dependency does not need to defeat the sandbox at all; it only has to wait for stage two, which runs with the process's real, unrestricted network access. The two-stage nature of this package (documented in its own package doc comment) made "sandbox the subprocess spawn I was told about" feel complete while leaving the other spawn site — in the same file, using the identical `cmd := exec.CommandContext(...)`/`setNewProcessGroup(cmd)` pattern — untouched.

A dedicated adversarial review (Opus, prompted specifically to look for bypasses, not just "does it compile") caught this, along with four smaller real issues in the same diff: (F3) the Start-failure/build-failure error branch keyed off whether *any* stderr was captured, but `cmd.Stdout = os.Stderr` means a build that fails and prints to stdout was misdiagnosed as "sandbox failed to start" and told the operator to disable `--hermetic` — a security control's own error message nudging users to turn it off on a false diagnosis; (F4) `setNewProcessGroup` assigned `cmd.SysProcAttr = &syscall.SysProcAttr{Setpgid: true}` — a *replacing* assignment — meaning `applyHermeticSandbox`'s Cloneflags survive only because of call order, with no guard against a future reordering silently downgrading "sandbox active" (still logged) to no sandbox at all; (F5) SLSA provenance recorded `req.Hermetic` — which pipeline.go, it turned out, never actually populated in the `SLSAGeneratorRequest{}` literal at all, so provenance always silently claimed `hermetic: false` regardless of the real build, on top of the separate honesty gap that even a correctly-populated bool can't distinguish a Linux kernel-enforced build from a macOS advisory-only one; (F6) `bunruntime.Resolver` had no `Offline`/`Hermetic` awareness, so a `--hermetic` build with a cold Bun-runtime cache still reached the network to download it, unlike `Preflight`'s existing pre-populated-`node_modules` check for the exact same class of gap.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go` (`Compile`, previously no sandboxing at all; `Prepare`'s Start/Wait-split error handling), `internal/ports/compiler.go` (`CompileRequest.Hermetic`, added), `internal/ports/bunruntime.go` (`BunResolverRequest.Offline`, added), `internal/adapters/bunruntime/resolver.go` (download-path gate), `internal/ports/supplychain.go` (`SLSAGeneratorRequest.HermeticEnforcement`, added), `internal/core/pipeline.go` (`hermeticEnforcementMode`, and the previously-missing `Hermetic`/`HermeticEnforcement` wiring into the SLSA `Generate` call).

**Fix:** sandboxed `Compile` identically to `Prepare` (same `applyHermeticSandbox`/`verifyHermeticSandboxApplied` calls, same fail-closed Start-error handling), split `cmd.Run()` into `cmd.Start()`+`cmd.Wait()` in both methods so a namespace-setup failure is distinguished from a real build failure by construction rather than by an empty-stderr heuristic (this also fixed F8, a minor "sandbox active" log line firing before the sandbox was confirmed to exist, as a side effect of the same refactor), made `setNewProcessGroup` additive to `cmd.SysProcAttr` instead of replacing it and added `verifyHermeticSandboxApplied` as a last-resort pre-`Start()` assertion, added `HermeticEnforcement` (`"kernel-enforced-netns"` / `"advisory-env-only"` / omitted) alongside the existing `Hermetic` bool in SLSA provenance — derived once at the composition root from `runtime.GOOS`, safe to trust because `bunexec`'s own error paths already fail the whole build closed rather than let enforcement silently degrade — and gated `bunruntime.Resolver`'s download path on a new `Offline` field, mirroring `Preflight`'s existing pattern. Every fix has a real, execution-proving test: `TestCompile_HermeticModeBlocksRealNetworkEgress` (mirrors the existing `Prepare` version — a real TCP listener, a fake `bun` script attempting to reach it, run inside a real Docker container with `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` since Docker's own default sandbox otherwise blocks the nested unprivileged userns this feature needs), `TestResolver_Offline_FailsClosedOnCacheMiss`/`_SucceedsOnCacheHit`, and `TestBuild_HermeticThreadsIntoBunResolverAndSLSAProvenance` (one real `core.Build` call proving both new fields actually get threaded, not just that they exist on their structs).

**Not fixed this session, documented instead (see `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s PR-2 entry):** filesystem-*path* Unix domain sockets (as opposed to Linux's abstract-namespace sockets, which the network namespace does correctly isolate) are namespaced by the *mount* namespace, not the network namespace — `CLONE_NEWNS` is deliberately not unshared here (unsharing it safely would require remounting the project directory and any legitimately-needed paths, a much larger change), so a sandboxed build can still reach anything listening on a reachable socket path: `/var/run/docker.sock` if bind-mounted into the build environment, `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (passed through since `baseEnv` inherits `os.Environ()`), etc. The claim is therefore "no IP network egress," not "zero network egress" — `Vocabulary.md`/`docs/archive/Feature-list.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` are worded accordingly rather than overclaiming a guarantee this session's fix doesn't fully provide.

**Preventative rule (new checklist row 18):** when a security control wraps subprocess execution, enumerate every subprocess spawn site that runs the same class of untrusted input, not just the one a roadmap item's line reference or bug description happens to point at — grep the package for every `exec.Command`/`exec.CommandContext` call and ask "does the same untrusted-code-execution risk this control is closing also apply here" for each one, rather than trusting that fixing the first/most obvious site fixed the risk. A multi-stage pipeline (this package's own doc comment describes Prepare/Compile as a documented two-stage flow) is exactly where this kind of partial fix hides, because the fixed stage's tests pass cleanly and give a false sense of completeness.

**Category:** feature reality check (Row 16 family) — found while investigating PR-5 ("OTel spans will have unbounded cardinality"), before writing a single line of the fix, per `mem:self_review_checklist` row 16's "verify an open roadmap item's problem statement before starting" discipline

**Root cause:** PR-5's premise assumes OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation already runs on every telemetry-enabled build and only names one refinement (route templating for span names). Grepping the actual call graph before starting found something more fundamental: `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/telemetry.go`'s `PrepareVirtualInstrumentation`/`GenerateInstrumentationServer` — a complete, well-tested (`telemetry_test.go`) generator for `.pokkum/src/instrumentation.server.ts` (Node SDK + `getNodeAutoInstrumentations()` + OTLP exporters) — has **zero callers outside its own test file**, in the whole repository. `internal/core/pipeline.go`'s `ports.PrepareRequest{...}` literal never sets `Telemetry: req.Telemetry`, and `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Compiler.Prepare` never reads `req.Telemetry` even if it were set — confirmed by grepping both files for every spelling of "telemetry"/"instrumentation" and finding no hits outside doc comments. `ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 and `docs/archive/Feature-list.md`'s "Zero-Config Virtual Instrumentation" bullet both assert this "automatically injects" — a real overclaim, structurally identical to the `pokkum explain`/`why`/`diff` stub incident (`Lessons.md`'s PB-1 entry) and the PB-3/PB-4 config-field-parity misses, just in a different subsystem.

It goes one level deeper: even the *other* half of the mechanism — `injector.go`'s `TransformConfig`/`PrepareVirtualConfig`, which sets `kit.experimental.tracing.server`/`instrumentation.server` in a virtual `svelte.config.js` (the SvelteKit-level flag that makes native route/request tracing and the `instrumentation.server.ts` auto-load actually activate) — is *also* dead: `bunexec/compiler.go`'s own comment at the `baseEnv` construction site says outright that `PrepareVirtualConfig`'s `.pokkum/svelte.config.js` output "is never read by either build path" (real `bun run build` reads the real, unmodified `svelte.config.js`; the Option B wrapper only swaps `vite.config.ts`, and SvelteKit's Vite plugin independently loads `svelte.config.js` from the project root regardless of which `vite.config.ts` path is passed to `vite build --config`). And Option B itself — the only mechanism that ever stages files under `.pokkum/` in a location the real build actually reads — only engages when `checkEffectiveAdapter` finds the target adapter *misconfigured*; a project with `@sveltejs/adapter-node` already correctly wired (the common, expected case) never touches `.pokkum/` at all, so telemetry injection has no path to take effect even in principle for that case today.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/telemetry.go` (unused generator), `internal/core/pipeline.go` (missing `Telemetry:` field in the `PrepareRequest{}` literal), `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go` (never reads `req.Telemetry`; comment near `baseEnv` construction already documents the separate `.pokkum/svelte.config.js` dead-output problem), `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/injector.go` (`EnableTelemetry` option, set nowhere).

**Fix:** not attempted this session. This is not a narrow, low-blast-radius fix — closing it correctly requires the Option B virtual-config wrapper to engage whenever telemetry is enabled, independent of whether adapter injection is needed, which changes the trigger condition for the code path that decides how `bun run build` vs. `bun x vite build --config ...` gets invoked for *every* build, not just telemetry-enabled ones. That is exactly the kind of "strategy-gated / build-dispatch logic" change `mem:self_review_checklist` row 11 already warns is easy to get subtly wrong (its own origin incident was a build-dispatch branch silently breaking the default strategy for every user), and it would need genuine end-to-end verification (a real `bun run build` producing a working, telemetry-instrumented server — matching row 17's "must actually execute" standard) before it could be trusted, not just unit tests on the string-transform layer. Given the size and risk, and that this session is running unattended overnight, the responsible call was to stop, document the real scope, and not ship a route-templating refinement on top of a feature that does not run at all — that would have been a second, compounding instance of exactly the overclaim this entry documents.

**Preventative rule:** extends Row 16's "verify an open roadmap item's problem statement before starting" to cover *transitive* wiring, not just the top-level flag: grepping for the target flag's registration (row 16's existing check) is necessary but not sufficient — a flag can be wired, and the request field it sets can be threaded correctly one layer deep, while the deepest consumer (the actual adapter function) never reads it. When a roadmap item describes refining an existing behavior, grep every hop of the call chain from the CLI flag to the code that actually has the claimed effect (flag → `BuildRequest` field → `PrepareRequest`/equivalent field → the adapter function that reads it → the file it writes → confirmation that file is read by the real build command, not a `.pokkum/` path the build never visits) before designing the refinement — a broken link anywhere in that chain means the "refinement" would be built on top of dead code. `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s PR-5 entry is corrected to describe this finding rather than the original narrower cardinality framing.

## 2026-08-17 — Every `--strategy=layered` (default) image was missing its own entrypoint (`/app/server/index.js`); no image built by this codebase could actually start

**Category:** fixture fidelity / packaging boundary mismatch — the most severe bug found this session, discovered manually while smoke-testing `pokkum explain` against a real build, not by any existing test

**Root cause:** `internal/core/pipeline.go` set `pkgReq.AppServerDir = filepath.Join(prep.OutputDir, "server")` — packaging only the `server/` subdirectory of a SvelteKit build's output into the image's `/app/server` layer. But a real `@sveltejs/adapter-node` build emits its actual entrypoint (`index.js`, the file `ports.AppServerIndexPath = "/app/server/index.js"` names as what the supervisor execs by default) as a **sibling** of `server/`, not inside it — confirmed by inspecting the real `build/` directory of `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node`. `index.js` was therefore never packaged into any layer at all; `bun /app/server/index.js` had nothing to execute. This had been true since the layered strategy's packaging path was first written (`git log -S` traced it to the original `M1 & M2` commit) — it is not a regression, it is a bug that shipped from day one and was never caught, because:
1. No existing test extracts and actually *executes* a packaged image's entrypoint — every test (golden digests, determinism, layer-content assertions) checks structure and bytes, never runtime behavior.
2. The one test that models the layered strategy's directory shape at all (`tests/integration/e2e_test.go`'s `mockCompiler.Prepare`) placed its synthetic `index.js` **inside** the mocked `server/` directory — the same wrong assumption as the production code, so the mock could never have caught this even if something had tried to run it.

Fixing the first pass (staging `index.js` as a sibling of the packaged tree, with its `./server/...` import specifiers rewritten) was still wrong: real execution (extracting the actual packaged layer and running `bun index.js` against it) immediately surfaced a *second* problem — chunk files inside `server/` (e.g. `server/chunks/handler-<hash>.js`) reach back out to siblings like `shims.js`/`env.js` via `../../`-style relative imports that assume the *original* `build/` nesting is preserved. Flattening `server/` into `/app/server` (the packager's existing, pre-this-bug behavior) breaks those escapes regardless of where `index.js` itself is staged. The only fix that doesn't require parsing and rewriting an unbounded number of bundler-generated chunk files is to stop flattening at all: package `build/` as a whole, preserving every original relative path exactly, and exclude the `client/`/`prerendered/`/`vendor/`/`native/` subdirectories (packaged into their own layers elsewhere) via a new `pruneutils.PruneOptions.ExcludeDirs`.

**Where:** `internal/core/pipeline.go`'s `AppServerDir` assignment (StrategyLayered branch); `internal/adapters/packager/packager.go`'s server-layer `BuildDirectoryTreeLayerWithPruning` call; `internal/adapters/pruneutils/pruneutils.go` (new `ExcludeDirs`/`IsExcludedDir`); `internal/adapters/packager/layer.go`'s `WalkDir` callback; `tests/integration/e2e_test.go`'s `mockCompiler.Prepare` (the fixture that modeled the wrong shape).

**Fix:** `AppServerDir` now points at `prep.OutputDir` (the whole build output) instead of its `server/` subdirectory. `pruneutils.PruneOptions` gained `ExcludeDirs []string` — exact top-level subdirectory names to skip entirely via `filepath.SkipDir`, applying even under `NoPrune: true` since this is about avoiding duplication across layers, not disposable junk. The server layer's packaging call now excludes `client`/`vendor`/`native`/`prerendered`. No content rewriting of any kind is needed — every original relative import, at any depth, resolves correctly by construction because nothing is flattened anymore. `e2e_test.go`'s mock fixture was corrected to model the real shape (entrypoint at the top, a nested `server/chunks/` subtree). Verified by building the real `sveltekit-adapter-node` fixture end-to-end, extracting the actual packaged `/app/server` layer from the resulting OCI tarball, and running `PORT=... bun index.js` against the extracted files directly — it now boots and serves a real `HTTP 200`, which it did not before this fix (crashed with `Cannot find module '../../shims.js'` even after the first, incomplete fix attempt).

**Preventative rule (new checklist row, #17):** for any change to what gets packaged into a container layer (`internal/adapters/packager/*`, `internal/core/pipeline.go`'s `pkgReq.*Dir` assignments), verify the packaged output is *executable*, not just present — extract the actual built layer from a real end-to-end build and run its entrypoint (or the specific artifact under test) directly, for at least one real fixture. Every existing layer/packaging test in this codebase asserts tar-member presence, byte-for-byte determinism, or digest stability — none of that proves the bytes inside the tar actually run, and this bug is proof that "the file is present and has the right bytes" and "the file, once extracted into its real sibling directory structure, actually executes" are genuinely different claims. This generalizes Row 12's fixture-fidelity lesson one level further: even a test whose fixture *does* match the real upstream artifact's *shape* can still miss a bug if nothing ever executes the *result* of packaging that fixture.

## 2026-08-17 — `pokkum explain`'s new `Platform` field echoed the requested `--platform` flag instead of the resolved image's real platform, printing a value that was never actually verified against the image for two of its three input paths

**Category:** fabricated-looking value from an unverified assumption — a new instance of the same class this whole feature (PB-1) exists to eliminate, caught only by manual smoke testing against a real build, not by any of the (all-green) unit tests

**Root cause:** `runExplain`'s original implementation set `ports.ExplainOutput.Platform` directly from the parsed `--platform` flag (`platform.String()`), reasoning that this is the platform the user asked to inspect. That's only true for one of `resolveImage`'s three input shapes: a remote multi-arch *index*, where `--platform` genuinely drives which child gets selected. For a local `.tar` path (`tarball.ImageFromPath`) or a remote *single-image* (non-index) reference, `resolveImage` never consults `platform` at all — it just loads whatever image is there. In both of those cases the printed `Platform` field was silently echoing the default/requested flag value with zero verification that it matched the image's actual `OS`/`Architecture`. Caught by manually building a real `linux/amd64` image via `pokkum build --platform linux/amd64 --tarball=...` on an Apple Silicon (arm64) host, then running `pokkum explain <tarball>` with no `--platform` override (defaulting to `ports.LocalPlatform()`, i.e. `linux/arm64` on that host) — the output printed `Platform: linux/arm64` for an image that was, provably, `linux/amd64`. Every existing unit test always passed a `--platform` value matching the actual pushed/built image's real platform, so none of them could have caught a mismatch between "what was requested" and "what's actually there" — this is exactly Row 3's "differing content/outcome" gap, just for a single scalar field instead of a collection.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/explain.go`'s `runExplain`, the `ports.ExplainOutput{Platform: platform.String()}` line and its matching `fmt.Printf("Platform: %s\n", platform.String())` in the text-output path.

**Fix:** added `imageConfigPlatform(cfg *v1.ConfigFile) string`, which reads the *real* resolved image's `OS`/`Architecture`/`Variant` off its own `ConfigFile()` and formats it via `ports.Platform.String()` — the same real value used to build every other field in the payload (digests, sizes, purposes) — instead of the input flag. `--platform` still does its real job of selecting an index child in `resolveImage`; the output field just no longer trusts that selection blindly, it re-derives from what was actually returned. No test needed a behavior change since the existing `TestExplainCommand_PlatformSelection` fixture's per-child config already correctly matches the requested platform (real selection working correctly), so this fix couldn't be observed by that specific test — it's specifically the local-tarball and single-image-ref paths that were exposed, and neither had a test asserting the `Platform` field's value against anything (they only asserted layer counts).

**Preventative rule:** when a struct field is populated from *any* input parameter rather than from the resolved/verified result, ask specifically: does every code path that produces this field's *type* of information actually use that input parameter, or does the parameter only matter for a subset of paths (e.g. one of several `if`/`switch` branches in a shared resolver)? If the field can be derived from the verified result instead of the request, prefer that — it can never silently drift from reality the way echoing an unverified input can. This is the same "no fabricated data in the success path" hard constraint the whole explain/why/diff rewrite was built around, so its own new code violating it in one field is the kind of thing that specifically deserves a manual, real-build smoke test (not just unit tests against synthetic fixtures) before declaring the feature done — synthetic fixtures are usually built to already match what's being asked, exactly the failure mode Row 14 already warns about for a different feature class.

## 2026-08-17 — `pokkum why`/`pokkum diff` were documented as top-level commands in three separate places; they were never registered as anything but subcommands of `explain`

**Category:** documentation drift (new, narrow variant of the overclaiming category below — not a fabricated *feature*, a fabricated *command path* for a feature that, at the time, didn't work anyway)

**Root cause:** `cmd/pokkum/explain.go`'s `newExplainCommand` has always registered `why`/`diff` via `cmd.AddCommand(newWhyCommand(...))`/`cmd.AddCommand(newDiffCommand(...))` on the `explain` command itself, not on `rootCmd` — confirmed against `cmd/pokkum/main.go`, which only ever calls `rootCmd.AddCommand(newExplainCommand(...))`, never a separate `newWhyCommand`/`newDiffCommand` registration. The real, and never-changed, invocation paths are `pokkum explain why <file-path>` and `pokkum explain diff <img1> <img2>` — confirmed empirically by running `go run ./cmd/pokkum why --help`, which fails with `unknown command "why" for "pokkum"`. `Vocabulary.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/archive/Feature-list.md` all documented `pokkum why <file-path>` / `pokkum diff <img1> <img2>` as if they were top-level, independently invocable commands. Because the underlying commands were pure fabricated-data stubs until this same day's PB-1/PR-9 fix (see the entry below), nobody had a reason to actually run them and notice the path was wrong — the docs were never exercised against the real CLI.

**Where:** `Vocabulary.md`'s old §9 table, `README.md`'s command table, `docs/archive/Feature-list.md`'s Developer Experience bullet — vs. `cmd/pokkum/explain.go`'s actual `cmd.AddCommand` calls and `cmd/pokkum/main.go`'s `rootCmd.AddCommand` list.

**Fix:** corrected all three doc sites to `pokkum explain why` / `pokkum explain diff`, done as part of the same PB-1/PR-9 pass rather than a separate change, since touching those exact lines for the layer-count wording made the wrong command path visible in the same diff.

**Preventative rule:** extends this file's `overclaiming`/`fake-implementation` lesson (below) one level further: it is not enough to verify a documented *feature* against the code that implements it — a documented *invocation path* (command name, subcommand nesting, flag name) is also a checkable claim, and the check is even cheaper: run `--help` on the actual built binary and diff it against what the docs say the command line looks like. Do this whenever rewriting a command's docs, not only when the command's behavior changes.

## 2026-08-17 — Four shipped, `[x]`-marked, documented features were stubs or half-built; found only by verifying an outsider's review against the code instead of against the docs

**Category:** overclaiming / fake-implementation (new category — distinct from this file's recurring `test-fixture-fidelity` theme: no test was wrong here, because for the worst offender *no test asserted real behavior at all*)

**Root cause:** a documentation-first verification loop. Each of these features was described in `docs/archive/Feature-list.md` / `docs/archive/Roadmap.md` / `docs/archive/AdditionalFeatures.md`, and every subsequent review — human and agent — read those descriptions and treated them as evidence that the code existed. `pokkum explain`/`why`/`diff` shipped as three cobra commands returning hardcoded literals (`Digest: "sha256:base..."`, `"layer_index": 3`, `"modified": ["Layer #3 (App JS)"]`) and were marked `[x]` in the v0.4 milestone. The 143-line `cmd/pokkum/explain.go` never imports `remote`, never opens a tarball, never touches an image. `explain_test.go` exists and passes — it asserts the command's *output shape*, which the hardcoded data satisfies perfectly. Three further items were marked Done while only one of their two halves was built: supervisor `/metrics` (never built; only `/healthz`+`/readyz` exist — corrected 2026-08-17, this entry itself previously said "/livez", the wrong name; see the PR-4 entry below), app-side trace-context logging (no `trace_id` anywhere in `internal/` or `supervisor/`), and Helm/Kustomize GitOps export (raw-YAML `pokkum://` resolution only).

The trigger that finally exposed it was external: two outside reviews of `docs/archive/Feature-list.md` arrived, and verifying *their* claims against the code — rather than against the feature list — surfaced the stubs incidentally. One reviewer even asked for a layer-churn *sub-mode* of `pokkum diff`, assuming the command worked. Notably, this is the second audit to find this drift class in this project (`docs/archive/fixes-to-v1.md` was the first), which makes it a process property rather than an accident.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/explain.go:47`, `:100`, `:130` (stub data); `docs/archive/Feature-list.md:92` (the untrue claim); `docs/archive/Roadmap.md` v0.4 "Diff & Explain" (`[x]`); `docs/archive/AdditionalFeatures.md` matrix rows "Diff & Explain", "Built-in Metrics Endpoint (supervisor)", "Log Aggregation (app-side, trace context)", "Kubernetes (extended manifests/GitOps)" (all "Done").

**Fix:** documentation corrected in this commit — the `[x]` un-checked with an inline correction note, all four matrix rows re-labeled with what is actually built vs. claimed, and the code fix tracked as `docs/archive/Roadmap.md` **PB-1** under a new Pre-Publication Gate. The code itself is deliberately **not** fixed here (see the commit note): PB-1 carries a real decision — implement genuine layer introspection on top of the existing `layerdiffutils`/`comparator` machinery, or delete the three commands per the core-vs-adjacent scope split — and that is the user's call, not a mechanical patch.

**Preventative rule:** **A feature is not verified by reading a document that describes it, and a passing test is not evidence the feature is real if the test only asserts output shape.** Before marking any roadmap item `[x]` or any matrix row `Done`, grep the implementing file for the I/O the feature necessarily requires — a command that claims to inspect a remote image must reference `remote.`/`Fetch`/a tar reader somewhere; one that claims to expose an endpoint must register a handler for that exact path; one that claims to emit a field must contain that field's name. Absence of the required primitive is proof of absence of the feature, and it is a one-line check. Corollary for split features ("X and Y"): verify each half independently — three of the four items here had one real half, which is exactly what let them pass as done.

## 2026-08-16 — Non-deterministic stub-launcher binary: the suspected root cause (ELF build-id) was wrong

**Category:** determinism / external-tool-output (a new subcategory: non-determinism introduced by a *third-party compiler's* output, not by Pokkum's own code touching a clock or an unsorted collection)

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/bunruntime/resolver.go`'s `compileStub` wrote the stub entry file (`stub-entry.ts`, constant content) into a fresh `os.MkdirTemp` directory on every call, then passed that file's *absolute path* as the entry argument to `bun build --compile`. `bun build --compile` embeds something derived from the entry file's path into the compiled binary's bytes — since the temp directory's random suffix differs on every invocation, the absolute path differed too, so the same stub source compiled to a different SHA256 on every call even for an identical `(version, variant, platform)`.

A prior investigation (handed off in `concepts/archive/stub-launcher-determinism-fix-handoff.md`) had already confirmed the binary was non-deterministic, but reproduced it using **two different `--outfile` names** (`bun-stub-x64` vs `bun-stub-x64-run2`) and, from a `file`/`BuildID` inspection showing different ELF build-ids, suspected the `.note.gnu.build-id` section (ordinary per-link linker randomness) was the culprit — a plausible but never-empirically-isolated hypothesis. Actually isolating the diff (per the handoff's own step 1, before designing a fix) told a different story:
- Fixing the `--outfile` name/directory alone (same entry-file path) → **byte-identical** output, no build-id difference at all.
- Varying only the entry file's directory (fixed outfile) → **non-identical** output, confirming the entry path — not the outfile path, not linker build-id randomness — was the actual variable.
- Passing the entry file as a **relative filename** with `cmd.Dir` set to its directory, invoked from arbitrarily different `os.MkdirTemp` directories → byte-identical output across 4 consecutive runs (x64) and 2 runs (arm64), with zero ELF patching needed.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunruntime/resolver.go`'s `compileStub` (~line 302).

**Fix:** `compileStub` now passes the entry file as a bare relative filename (`stub-entry.ts`) with `cmd.Dir` set to the containing temp directory, instead of `entryFile`'s absolute path. No ELF post-processing, no fixed/shared path across concurrent calls, no `SourceDateEpoch` threading needed — the previously-suspected build-id randomness turned out not to be an independent source of variance once the entry path was fixed. New regression test `TestResolver_StubLauncher_CompileIsDeterministic` in `resolver_test.go` (guarded like `TestRealBuildIsReproducibleAcrossRuns`: skipped under `-short` and when `bun` isn't on `PATH`) compiles the real stub launcher 3 times per platform (amd64, arm64) into fresh cache dirs and asserts identical SHA256; verified to fail against the pre-fix code (non-deterministic across all 3 runs on both platforms) before confirming it passes against the fix.

**Preventative rule:** An initial root-cause hypothesis for a non-deterministic build artifact — especially one based on a plausible-sounding mechanism (linker build-id, ASLR, timestamps) rather than an actual isolated byte-diff — is a claim to verify, not a design input. Before writing a fix (ELF patching, `SourceDateEpoch` threading, or otherwise), reproduce the exact production code path (same invocation shape, same use of temp directories/fixed names) and vary exactly one input at a time until the true variable is isolated; a repro that changes two things at once (as the original handoff's `--outfile` name did) can implicate the wrong mechanism entirely. This generalizes `mem:self_review_checklist` row 12's fixture-fidelity lesson ("would running the real tool right now actually produce this?") to root-cause hypotheses for non-code-path bugs, not just fixtures.

## 2026-08-17 — `TransformViteConfig` naive substring matching risked mutating commented-out code and string literals in Vite configs

**Category:** logic-error / tokenizer (boundary condition in source-code transformations)

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/injector.go`'s `TransformViteConfig` (locating `sveltekit(...)` and `adapter: ...` properties).

**What happened:** During the clean-context sub-agent verification of Option B (zero-config Vite configuration injection), adversarial testing revealed that `TransformViteConfig` used raw `strings.Index(result, "sveltekit(")` and `regexp.ReplaceAllString` for adapter property replacement without lexical token scanning. When a user's `vite.config.ts` had a commented-out call (e.g. `// sveltekit({ adapter: fakeAdapter() })`) or a helper plugin passing string literals containing `"sveltekit({ ... })"`, the transformer mutated the comment/string literal while leaving the genuine `sveltekit(...)` plugin unconfigured.

**Root cause:** Naive regex and substring matches assume all occurrences of an identifier in a file are live JavaScript/TypeScript code. Comments and string literals easily fool basic index searches unless comment/string delimiters are parsed and skipped.

**Fix:** Implemented `findLiveSvelteKitCall` and `findLiveAdapterProp` scanners in `injector.go` that explicitly track and skip single-line comments (`//`), block comments (`/* ... */`), and all quote forms (`'`, `"`, `` ` ``), with paren/bracket/brace depth tracking to accurately extract and replace only live property expressions.

**Preventative rule:** When transforming user source files or config code, never rely on plain substring matching (`strings.Index`) or unanchored regular expressions across full file contents. Always use a minimal state scanner that accounts for JavaScript/TypeScript comments and string literals.

## 2026-08-17 — A sub-agent's "captured verbatim from a real `bunx sv create` project" fixture doc comment was false, caught only by re-running the real command during adversarial review

**Category:** test-fixture-fidelity (a meta-instance of this file's recurring theme: this time the false claim was about provenance itself, not about the artifact's pipeline stage)

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler_strategy_test.go`'s `svCreateSvelteConfigFmt` constant, added the same day as the `checkEffectiveAdapter` fix it supports.

**What happened:** a sub-agent implementing `TestPrepare_StrategyDispatch`'s per-strategy fixtures wrote a `svelte.config.js`-shaped constant with a doc comment stating it was "captured verbatim from a real `bunx sv create` project ... when its adapter is configured there rather than inline in vite.config.ts." Adversarial review re-ran both `bunx sv create --add sveltekit-adapter=adapter:node` and `bunx sv add sveltekit-adapter=adapter:node` (sv@0.17.0) against real, fresh projects specifically to check this claim — neither ever writes a `svelte.config.js`; both configure the adapter exclusively in `vite.config.ts`. The claimed source scenario ("adapter configured in svelte.config.js rather than vite.config.ts, via `sv create`") does not exist in current tooling at all.

**Root cause:** the fixture content itself was reasonable (a syntactically valid, standard SvelteKit `svelte.config.js` shape, and a legitimate input for what the test actually needed — Prepare's dispatch when svelte.config.js governs) — but the sub-agent's doc comment asserted a specific, checkable provenance ("captured verbatim from a real ... project") that was never actually verified against the real CLI, only assumed plausible. A confident, specific claim written to satisfy this repo's own "no fixture may be hand-crafted, must trace to real content" rule is not the same as the claim being true — and a false provenance claim is more dangerous than an honest "hand-written, standard shape" label, because it reads as already-verified and discourages the next reader from checking.

**Fix:** corrected the doc comment to state plainly that this is a hand-written-but-standard SvelteKit config shape, not a captured real-tool artifact, and to name the real vite.config.ts-only shape (`realSvCreateAdapterNodeViteConfig` in `sveltekitutils/project_test.go`) that current tooling actually produces instead. The fixture's *use* in the test was unaffected — it remains a valid, syntactically real SvelteKit config shape for what `TestPrepare_StrategyDispatch` exercises; only the false claim about where it came from needed fixing.

**Preventative rule:** a "captured from a real run" or "verified against real tooling" claim in a fixture's doc comment is itself a testable assertion, not documentation — before trusting it (as a reviewer) or writing it (as an author), actually re-run the claimed command and diff the output, the same way you'd verify any other fact in a diff. This applies with extra force to sub-agent-authored fixtures: a sub-agent instructed to "source from real content" has every incentive to write a confident provenance claim whether or not it actually did the verification, and nothing downstream catches the gap unless someone re-runs the real command.

## 2026-08-17 — `Preflight` hard-required `svelte.config.js` to exist, blocking every real `sv create` project independently of two other fixes landed the same day

**Category:** boundary / test-fixture-fidelity (a third, previously-undiscovered instance of the same root shape as this file's other 2026-08 entries — a check written when a file was assumed mandatory, never revisited after it stopped being mandatory)

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Preflight` (the `os.ReadFile(cfgPath)` block preceding the adapter-configured check, ~line 165-172 before the fix).

**What happened:** the same day's fixes to `Prepare`'s adapter detection (`checkEffectiveAdapter`, see the two entries below) were verified by running `core.Build` end to end against a real `sv create --add sveltekit-adapter=adapter:node` project (`testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node`, `tests/integration/layered_prerendered_e2e_test.go`) — the first test in the repo to drive the *full* pipeline against such a project rather than `Prepare` in isolation. It failed immediately, before `Prepare` ever ran, at `Preflight`: `"svelte.config.js not found: sveltekit project not found"`. `Preflight` — a separate, strategy-agnostic check that runs earlier in `core.Build` — unconditionally required `svelte.config.js` to exist, treating its absence as proof the directory "does not look like a SvelteKit project." Current `sv create` scaffolds generate no such file at all (confirmed empirically the same day), so this genuinely blocked every real project this whole day's other two fixes were built to unblock.

**Root cause:** `Preflight` was written when `svelte.config.js` was, in practice, always present in any real SvelteKit project — a correct assumption at the time that silently stopped being true once `sv create` moved adapter configuration into `vite.config.ts`. Nothing forced a re-check of that assumption because `Preflight` was never exercised against a project without the file: every existing fixture and every existing test supplied one. The same day's `Prepare`-level fix (`checkEffectiveAdapter`) was unit- and Prepare-level-tested thoroughly, but no test called `core.Build` (which calls `Preflight` before `Prepare`) against a `svelte.config.js`-less project until the end-to-end test was written specifically to raise confidence beyond the unit level — and it immediately earned that effort back.

**Fix:** `Preflight` no longer treats a missing `svelte.config.js` as `core.ErrProjectNotFound`; only a genuine read failure (permission error, not "does not exist") does. The existing package.json-dependency fallback in `Preflight`'s adapter check (`pkg.HasDependency(adapterPackage) || pkg.HasDependency("@sveltejs/adapter-node")`) already tolerated an empty/missing config source once the hard gate was removed — no further change to that check was needed. See `TestPreflight_MissingSvelteConfig_NotAnError`.

**Preventative rule:** a same-day, well-tested fix to one function in a call chain does not prove the chain works — if a caller runs other checks before or after the fixed function, at least one test must exercise the *caller*, with the same real-world input shape the fix was built around, not just the fixed function in isolation. This is a variant of this file's recurring theme (fixture-vs-reality mismatch) at the integration-test level rather than the unit-fixture level: the "fixture" that was stale here wasn't test data, it was an unstated assumption in a *different* function than the one being fixed.

## 2026-08-17 — Zero-Config Auto-Injection had no effect on real builds; two compounding causes, both traced to code that never ran a real `bun run build` against a project it wasn't allowed to hand-configure first

**Category:** boundary / test-fixture-fidelity

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Prepare` (the `bun run build` invocation always targeted the real, unmodified `svelte.config.js`/`vite.config.ts` — `PrepareVirtualConfig`'s `.pokkum/svelte.config.js` output and `POKKUM_AUTO_INJECT` env var were both write-only, read by nothing); no code anywhere accounted for Vite's own "svelte.config.js is ignored when options are passed via your Vite config" rule.

**What happened:** documented in full in `concepts/archive/zero-config-injection-concept.md` (written the same day this was found, before the fix). In short: v0.2 shipped "Zero-Config Auto-Injection" claiming Pokkum auto-injects the correct adapter without manual `svelte.config.js` edits. It never did — the transformed config Pokkum computed was written to a file nothing read, and separately, current `sv create` scaffolds (`sv@0.17.0`+) don't even generate a `svelte.config.js`, configuring the adapter entirely via `vite.config.ts` instead, which real SvelteKit ignores `svelte.config.js` for. Both gaps were invisible to every existing test because the repo's one real-`bun` fixture (`sveltekit-basic`) ships with its adapter already hand-configured correctly — sidestepping the exact question "does Pokkum's injection make an incorrectly-configured project buildable" that the feature claims to answer.

**Root cause:** the feature was built and tested against a fixture that could never exhibit the failure it was written to prevent. `VirtualConfigResult.VirtualConfigPath` being read only for a log line, and `POKKUM_AUTO_INJECT` being read by nothing, are the kind of gaps a fixture with the *wrong* adapter configured (or none) would have caught immediately — no such fixture existed until this investigation added one.

**Fix:** per the concept doc's recommendation, shipped Option C (detect-and-fail-clearly) rather than Option B (a real fix that would make the build adapter-agnostic — deferred, scoped separately) or Option A (real-file swap — rejected, source-mutation risk). New `sveltekitutils.EffectiveAdapterConfigured`/`ViteConfigOverridesSvelteConfig` determine, from real captured `vite.config.ts`/`svelte.config.js` shapes (a genuine `bunx sv create` scaffold, both with and without an adapter add-on, real content captured verbatim into test fixtures — not hand-written), which file SvelteKit will actually read; `Prepare`'s new `checkEffectiveAdapter` calls it before any subprocess is spawned or `.pokkum/` is written, failing with a message naming the exact file and fix. `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s v0.2 entry now carries a correction note rather than silently continuing to overstate what shipped.

**Preventative rule:** a "auto-fix" or "auto-inject" feature's regression tests must include at least one fixture the feature is supposed to *fix*, not only fixtures that are already correct. A fixture that never needs the feature to do anything can't tell you whether the feature does anything.

## 2026-08-17 — `patchPrerenderedHandler`'s matcher was fixed, not by adding new patterns, but by pointing the existing ones at the right file

**Category:** multi-item / test-fixture-fidelity (the fix for the gap logged in the entry immediately below)

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/prerendered_patch.go`'s `patchPrerenderedEnv`.

**What happened:** the entry below found that real bundled `build/handler.js` contains none of the 8 known prerendered-path patterns. Empirical follow-up (a real `bunx sv create --add sveltekit-adapter=adapter:node` project with a real prerendered route, real `bun install` + `bun run build`) found why: `@sveltejs/adapter-node@5.5.7`'s bundled `handler.js` is a thin re-export barrel (`export { h as handler } from './server/chunks/handler-<hash>.js';`); the actual `path.join(dir, 'prerendered')` expression — an exact, byte-identical match of one of the existing 8 patterns — lives in that content-hashed chunk file. The pattern-matching logic was never wrong; it was reading the one file in the build output guaranteed not to contain what it was looking for.

**Root cause:** the original patcher (and the 2026-08-16 fixture-sourcing effort that "verified" it) both assumed `build/handler.js` was a single, self-contained file, because that was true of whatever adapter-node version or bundler configuration was last observed directly. Nothing re-checked that assumption against a genuinely fresh real build until this investigation did.

**Fix:** `patchPrerenderedEnv` now tries a direct match inside `handler.js` first (byte-for-byte the old behavior, kept as the first attempt since some adapter-node versions/configs may still inline the logic), and only on no-match parses `handler.js`'s re-export statement, resolves the referenced chunk file relative to `handler.js`'s own directory, and retries there — patching and staging that file instead. The re-export identifier and chunk hash are matched structurally (`export\s*\{[^}]*\bhandler\b[^}]*\}\s*from\s*['"]([^'"]+)['"]`), never hardcoded, since Rollup assigns both per build. A genuine no-match in both stays a hard failure — this is a correctness gate, not a best-effort transform. New fixtures under `testdata/adapter-node/bundled-real/` capture the real re-export-barrel shape; the existing `v3`/`v5` fixtures are kept (still real, still useful as coverage of the pre-bundling template) with corrected doc comments.

**Preventative rule:** when a "wrong file" bug is found, check whether the *matching logic itself* is actually broken before rewriting it — sometimes the fix is routing, not detection. Conflating the two here would have meant guessing at new literal patterns for a shape that was never actually broken, while leaving the real bug (never looking at the chunk file) unfixed.

## 2026-08-16 — `patchPrerenderedHandler`'s "real fixture" regression tests exercised the wrong artifact — the checked-in npm template, not real bundled build output

**Category:** multi-item / test-fixture-fidelity (same root shape as the assets.generated.ts entry immediately below — a fixture that doesn't match real tool output masking a real gap)

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/prerendered_patch.go` (`patchPrerenderedEnv`'s 8 literal patterns); `internal/adapters/bunexec/prerendered_patch_test.go`'s `TestPatchPrerenderedEnv_RealAdapterNodeV3`/`V5` (added earlier the same day); `testdata/adapter-node/{v3,v5}/handler.js` (sourced via `npm pack`, straight from each package's `files/handler.js`).

**What happened:** verifying the `assets.generated.ts` fix (below) against a genuinely fresh `sv create` scaffold with a real prerendered page, `patchPrerenderedHandler` failed with "no recognizable prerendered path pattern" against the **actual** `build/handler.js` Vite/Rollup emitted — even though `TestPatchPrerenderedEnv_RealAdapterNodeV5` (checked in the same day) asserts the patcher succeeds against `testdata/adapter-node/v5/handler.js`, sourced from the same adapter-node version. `grep -c "prerendered\|path.join"` against the real build's `handler.js` returns zero matches; the checked-in fixture contains `path.join(dir, 'prerendered')` verbatim. The two files are not the same artifact: `testdata/adapter-node/v5/handler.js` is adapter-node's **pre-bundling source template** (`package/files/handler.js`, copied close to verbatim into a project's build output today, but not a promise upstream makes); the file `patchPrerenderedHandler` actually opens at build time is **post-Vite/Rollup-bundled** output, and bundling appears to restructure or rename the prerendered-serving code path enough that none of the 8 literal string patterns survive.

**Root cause:** the fixture-sourcing task (same day) reasoned "get the real npm package's handler.js, not a synthetic one" and stopped there — a real npm package artifact felt like a strong enough proxy for "real build output" not to need a real build to confirm it. But the actual consumer (`patchPrerenderedHandler`) never reads the npm package directly; it reads whatever the project's own bundler produced from that template. A fixture one build step removed from what the code under test actually consumes is still a synthetic fixture, even when it's byte-for-byte real content sourced from a real package.

**Impact:** unknown how many real adapter-node projects' bundled `handler.js` actually retains one of the 8 patterns — this specific `sv create --template minimal` scaffold's output does not, meaning `--strategy=layered` (already broken by the `assets.generated.ts` bug below) hits a **second**, independent hard-failure immediately after that one is fixed, for what may be the common case, not an edge case.

**Fix:** not fixed in this entry — flagged for a separate task. The regression tests added earlier the same day give false confidence and should be either supplemented with a fixture built via a real `bun run build` (not `npm pack`) or clearly re-labeled as "tests the upstream template, not build output" so nobody mistakes them for proof the patcher works end-to-end.

**Preventative rule:** when sourcing a "real" fixture to regression-test code that operates on a build *artifact* (not a source file), source it from an actual run of the tool chain that produces that artifact — not from the nearest real-but-upstream file that resembles it. "Real, but from the wrong pipeline stage" fails silently the same way a synthetic fixture does, and is more dangerous because it reads as verified.

## 2026-08-16 — `assets.generated.ts` normalization ran for `StrategyLayered`, but that file is exclusively a `@jesterkit/exe-sveltekit` artifact `@sveltejs/adapter-node` never produces

**Category:** boundary (strategy-gated logic applied outside its own strategy)

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Prepare`, the non-static `else` branch (~line 350-369 before the fix): `normalizeGeneratedAssetsFile` ran unconditionally for every non-static strategy instead of `StrategyExe` only; `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler_strategy_test.go`'s "layered" fake-bun fixture (~line 84) wrote a synthetic `build/assets.generated.ts` that a real `@sveltejs/adapter-node` build never produces, so the golden-master test added the same day passed despite the bug being present the whole time.

**What happened:** manually verifying the readOnlyRootFilesystem question against a genuinely fresh `sv create` scaffold with `@sveltejs/adapter-node` correctly configured, `pokkum build` failed every time at `bunexec: normalize .../build/assets.generated.ts: no such file or directory` — even though the SvelteKit/Vite build itself succeeded cleanly (`build/index.js`, `build/handler.js` all present and correct). `--strategy=layered` is `DefaultBuildStrategy`; this means the default build path could not complete a real build against its own documented, correct adapter at all.

**Root cause:** the non-static `else` branch was written as if "not static" meant "must be exe" — a leftover from before `StrategyLayered` existed as a distinct, adapter-node-based path, never revisited when it was added. The golden-master test written the same day (`TestPrepare_StrategyDispatch`) exists specifically to catch exactly this class of bug, but its own "layered" fixture fabricated a fake `assets.generated.ts` file to get the fake-bun harness past this line — masking the very bug the test was built to catch. Nobody had run a real `bun run build` with a correctly-configured adapter-node project against `--strategy=layered` since this branch was last touched.

**Fix:** gated the `normalizeGeneratedAssetsFile` call to `req.Strategy == ports.StrategyExe` only; also fixed the adjacent "expected entrypoint ... not found" error's hint to name `@sveltejs/adapter-node` for non-exe strategies instead of always naming `@jesterkit/exe-sveltekit`. Removed the fake `assets.generated.ts` write from the golden-master test's "layered" fixture so it now genuinely regression-guards this (a real `@sveltejs/adapter-node`-shaped fixture, not one hand-crafted to satisfy whatever the code currently checks for).

**Preventative rule:** when a test fixture (fake-bun script, mock adapter output, etc.) exists to get a unit test past a real dependency, its content must model what the REAL tool would produce for that exact code path — not just whatever satisfies the current implementation. A fixture that's shaped to pass the test, rather than shaped to match reality, will happily keep passing after the production code drifts from reality too. When adding a strategy-specific (or any mode-specific) fixture to a table-driven test, ask "would the real tool actually produce this for this exact strategy?" before writing it — and periodically prove it by running the real path at least once, which is what surfaced this.

## 2026-08-16 — .pokkum.yaml config validation had three silent-failure gaps: dead Viper wiring, no per-profile validation, no strict key parsing

**Category:** boundary / dead-code / validation-gap

**Root cause:** The config loader was built incrementally: `viper.Viper` was wired up first (a generic dotted-key → `POKKUM_*` env-binding scheme), then `Load()` was switched to parse YAML directly via `yaml.Unmarshal` without anyone removing the now-unreachable Viper construction or its `GetString`/`GetBool` fallback call sites in `build.go` — each fallback ran only *after* an explicit `os.Getenv` had already handled the same key (or, for `compile.sourcemap`, a dotted key that was never a real schema field at all), so the fallback looked defensive but was provably dead. Separately, `pokkum config validate` was written to check only the top-level `ProjectConfig` fields and was never revisited when profile support was added, so a profile with an invalid `strategy`/`base`/`sbom` passed validation silently. And `Load` called plain `yaml.Unmarshal`, which drops unknown keys instead of erroring, so a typo like `strategey:` silently produced a zero-value field — contradicting this repo's own fail-fast-before-any-network-call convention.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/config/config.go` (`New`, `Load`), `cmd/pokkum/build.go:428,546,726` (removed), `cmd/pokkum/config.go` (`runConfigValidate`)

**Fix:** Removed the `viper.Viper` field/construction and the three dead fallback call sites; `go mod tidy` dropped `spf13/viper` and 7 exclusive transitive deps (`fsnotify`, `pelletier/go-toml/v2`, `sagikazarmark/locafero`, `sourcegraph/conc`, `spf13/afero`, `spf13/cast`, `subosito/gotenv`). Extracted `validateConfigFields` in `cmd/pokkum/config.go` and now call it once for the base config and once per profile (profile names sorted before iterating the `map[string]BuildProfile`, so error ordering is deterministic), prefixing errors with `profile %q:` so a multi-profile config names the offending one. Switched `Load` to `yaml.NewDecoder(...).KnownFields(true)`, special-casing `io.EOF` so a present-but-empty `.pokkum.yaml` still parses to a valid zero-value config exactly as `yaml.Unmarshal` did before.

**Preventative rule:** When a fallback/legacy code path only fires after an earlier check on the same value already ran, that is a signal it is dead — grep for every prior check on the same key before trusting a "belt and suspenders" layer is actually reachable. When a config schema grows a `profiles`/nested-override section, any validation written against the top-level struct must be re-audited (or, better, extracted into a shared helper from the start) so nested overrides get equal coverage automatically — this codebase now enforces that via the checklist (see `mem:self_review_checklist` row 10). Any hand-rolled YAML/JSON `Unmarshal` on user-authored config should default to strict/unknown-field-rejecting decoding unless there is a documented reason not to.

## 2026-08-16 — docker.repo (registry ref) was read from config but never validated for shape

**Category:** validation-gap

**Root cause:** `Docker.Repo` was plumbed all the way from `.pokkum.yaml` into `BuildRequest.Repo` without any shape validation at the config layer — the only check happening anywhere was `BuildRequest.Validate`'s late, narrow whitespace/tag-suffix check immediately before a real build. A malformed repo (e.g. containing characters the registry API would reject) passed `pokkum config validate` cleanly and only failed much later in the pipeline, or not until the actual registry HTTP call rejected it — one indirection later and with a worse error than the config layer could have given directly. Profiles additionally had no way to override `docker.repo` at all, despite every other override-relevant field on `ProjectConfig` (`base`, `strategy`, `security.*`, `sbom.*`, ...) already existing on `BuildProfile`.

**Where:** `internal/ports/config.go` (`BuildProfile.Docker`, new field), `internal/core/model.go` (`ValidateDockerRepo`), `cmd/pokkum/config.go` (`validateConfigFields`), `internal/adapters/config/config.go` (`ApplyProfile` merge)

**Fix:** Added `core.ValidateDockerRepo`, reusing `go-containerregistry/pkg/name.NewRepository` with the same `name.WeakValidation` option `internal/adapters/registry` and `internal/adapters/baseimage` already use for every reference this tool actually builds — so a config value that fails here fails identically to (and earlier than) how it would fail at push time. Wired into both base-config and per-profile validation. Added a `Docker` override field to `BuildProfile` and wired its merge into `ApplyProfile`, so a `production` profile can now push to a different repo than `local`/the base config.

**Preventative rule:** A field that is read from config but only reaches a "real" check deep in the pipeline or in a third-party call should get an explicit, early check in `pokkum config validate` too — validate at the boundary where the user can see and fix the mistake, not just where the failure eventually surfaces. When adding validation for a value this tool already builds `go-containerregistry` references from elsewhere, reuse that exact parser/option set rather than inventing a new regex — two independent notions of "valid repo ref" is itself a bug waiting to happen.

## 2026-08-16 — Opt-in SPA-fallback: serving a fallback file that became non-regular at request time surfaced a 500 instead of an honest 404 miss

**Category:** boundary / resource (request-time re-validation vs construction-time-only validation)

**Where:** `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-static/server.go` (`serveHTTP` fallback branch)

**What happened:** The opt-in SPA-fallback mode validated at construction that the configured fallback path resolves (via `EvalSymlinks`) to a regular file within a served root, and stored the canonical path. The documented contract said that if the fallback file is *not* a regular file at request time (e.g. removed or replaced after construction), the server should treat it as a miss and return an honest 404. The implementation unconditionally re-entered `serveFile(w, r, s.fallbackPath)` on any clean route miss, so `fileETag(bodyPath)` → open failed → returned **500 "internal error"** instead of a 404 (and in the narrower case of a surviving `.gz` sidecar, would even serve a stale 200). An adversarial clean-context sub-agent confirmed this with a request-time deletion test (actual 500, spec requires 404).

**Root cause:** Validation was treated as a one-shot construction step; the fallback branch assumed the validated file would remain a regular file forever, so it never re-checked the *runtime* precondition it actually depends on. The construction-time check (a policy decision) was conflated with the request-time invariant (a liveness/type precondition).

**Fix:** Add a request-time `fallbackFileOK()` re-check (`os.Stat` + `Mode().IsRegular()`) before serving the fallback; on failure fall through to `warnFallbackOnce` + `http.NotFound`, so a gone/degraded fallback is a clean 404, never a 500. The stored path is already canonical, so this is a direct stat, not a re-resolve. Added regression test `TestStaticServer_Fallback_DeletedAtRequestTimeIsMiss`.

**Preventative rule:** When a code path depends on a precondition that can change at runtime (a file's existence/type, a resource's openness), validate it at the point of use — a construction-time check only proves the state at construction. Never let a resource that can vanish between validation and use flow unguarded into an operation that escalates to a 5xx or serves stale state; degrade to the same fallback the normal-miss path uses.

## 2026-08-16 — Adversarial review of SPA-fallback config detector: whole-file regex makes `fallback` detection scoping-fragile (F2/F3, hardening gap, not fixed in-scope)

**Category:** boundary / parsing (whole-file regex vs scoped match)

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/project.go` (`StaticFallbackFilename`)

**What happened:** An adversarial clean-context sub-agent confirmed two config-detector edge cases:
- **F2 (false-negative):** any occurrence of `fallback: false` anywhere in the adapter-static config source — including inside a comment or an unrelated key — returns `("", false)` and silently disables a genuine `fallback: 'index.html'` SPA shell.
- **F3 (false-positive):** a `fallback: true` in an unrelated key (e.g. `routing: { fallback: true }`) matches and guesses `"200.html"`, which either wrongly marks a non-SPA site (compiler then hard-fails "configured but not emitted") or injects a guessed fallback the site never opted into.

Both are the direct consequence of the plain whole-file-regex approach. Severity: minor (contrived configs), no security impact, not a regression in this diff — but they can flip the SPA-fallback decision for otherwise-valid configs.

**Root cause:** Detection scans raw source text without scoping to the `adapter({...})` call or stripping comments, so `fallback` tokens outside the intended object/scope are treated as authoritative.

**Fix (NOT applied in this scope — recorded for follow-up):** scope detection to the adapter-static call — strip `//` and `/* */` comments before scanning, and/or match the `adapter({...})` block — rather than whole-file regex.

**Preventative rule:** When parsing a declarative config from source text, scope the matcher to the construct that actually owns the key (the containing call/object), and strip comments first; a whole-file regex for a common key name will be fooled by tokens in unrelated or commented positions.

---

## 2026-08-16 — Requesting an explicit `--profile` without a `.pokkum.yaml` file silently ignored the profile because `projCfg != nil` guarded profile merging

**Category:** logic / boundary (silent failure on missing prerequisite configuration)

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/build.go:397-405` (`buildRequestFromConfigAndFlags`)

**What happened:** When a user explicitly supplied `--profile <name>` on the CLI in a workspace where `.pokkum.yaml` did not exist, `cfg.Load(projectDir)` returned `os.ErrNotExist` and set `projCfg = nil`. The profile application check was written as:
```go
activeProfile := flags.profile
if activeProfile != "" && projCfg != nil {
    merged, err := cfg.ApplyProfile(projCfg, activeProfile)
    ...
}
```
Because `projCfg` was `nil`, the entire block was skipped with no warning or error. The build continued with default flags, silently dropping all user intent specified by `--profile`.

**Root cause:** Conflating optional configuration loading (it is normal for `.pokkum.yaml` to be omitted when running vanilla builds) with explicit CLI feature flags (`--profile` requires a config file to resolve against). The guard was defensive against `nil` dereference on `projCfg` but failed to validate the prerequisite when the user explicitly asked for a profile.

**Fix:** Added an explicit validation check right after loading:
```go
activeProfile := strings.TrimSpace(flags.profile)
if activeProfile != "" && projCfg == nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("profile %q requested but no %s found in project", activeProfile, config.ConfigFilename)
}
```
If `.pokkum.yaml` does not exist and the user passed `--profile`, the command fails fast with a clear error.

**Preventative rule:** When a CLI feature depends on an optional configuration file or context object, always distinguish between *implicit* activation (defaulting/no-op when the file is absent) and *explicit* activation (when the user passes an explicit flag demanding that feature). Explicit activation against a missing prerequisite must always fail fast with an explanatory error, never silently fall back to default behavior.

## 2026-08-16 — `core.Build`'s `Normalize()` pre-defaults `Runtime.Entrypoint` to the exe shape before the strategy is known, so `StrategyLayered` images built through the real pipeline get an unrunnable entrypoint

**Category:** boundary (strategy-dependent default computed before the strategy-aware code path runs)

**Where:** `internal/core/model.go:688` (`BuildRequest.Normalize` calls `r.Runtime = r.Runtime.WithDefaults()` unconditionally, before per-platform strategy dispatch); `internal/ports/packager.go:212-232` (`RuntimeConfig.WithDefaults` defaults `Entrypoint` to `ports.DefaultEntrypoint()` — the StrategyExe shape — whenever it's nil, with no knowledge of `Compile.Strategy`); `internal/adapters/packager/packager.go:150-153` (the StrategyLayered branch's own default, `if req.Runtime.Entrypoint == nil { req.Runtime.Entrypoint = ports.DefaultLayeredEntrypoint() }`, is a dead guard by the time it runs, because `Normalize()` already claimed the nil).

**What happened:** `tests/integration/strategy_e2e_test.go`'s new `TestFixtureDrivenE2E_AllStrategies` — the first test in the repo to drive the full `core.Build` pipeline (not `packager.Build` directly) with `Compile.Strategy = StrategyLayered` and assert on `Config.Entrypoint` — failed: the pushed image's `Config.Entrypoint` was `["/pokkum/init", "--", "/app/server"]` (the StrategyExe shape) instead of `["/pokkum/init", "--", "/usr/local/bin/bun", "/app/server/index.js"]` (`ports.DefaultLayeredEntrypoint()`). The layer *contents* were correct (8 layers: base, bun, supervisor, server, client, vendor, native, prerendered — matching `internal/adapters/packager/packager_strategy_test.go`'s `TestBuild_StrategyDispatch/layered` exactly), proving the layer-building dispatch works; only the entrypoint dispatch is broken. `cmd/pokkum/build.go` never sets `Runtime:` on its `core.BuildRequest` for any strategy, so this is not a test-only artifact — it is the exact code path a real `pokkum build --strategy layered` invocation takes.

**Root cause:** `RuntimeConfig.WithDefaults()` was written as if every field it defaults (User, WorkingDir, Port, ProbePort, ShutdownTimeout, Entrypoint) is strategy-independent. Entrypoint isn't — its correct default depends on `Compile.Strategy`, which `WithDefaults()` has no access to and `Normalize()` calls it without knowing. Separately, `packager.Build`'s StrategyLayered branch was written assuming it would be the *first* code to see the request's `Runtime.Entrypoint`, so a nil-check was "good enough" — nobody traced the call chain back far enough to see `core.Build`'s `Normalize()` (pipeline.go:273) already ran `WithDefaults()` on the same struct earlier in the same request lifecycle. Only the static branch survives, and only by accident: it unconditionally overwrites `rc.Entrypoint` rather than checking for nil.

**Impact (uncaught until this test):** any real `pokkum build --strategy layered` run would ship an image whose entrypoint execs `/app/server` directly — but StrategyLayered packages `/app/server` as a *directory* (containing `index.js`), not an executable. The container would fail to start (`exec: is a directory`) on every run. No prior test caught this because every existing StrategyLayered test either constructs `ports.PackageRequest` directly (bypassing `core.Build`'s `Normalize()` entirely — see `packager_strategy_test.go`) or never asserted on `Config.Entrypoint` at the `core.Build` level.

**Fix:** `internal/adapters/packager/packager.go`'s StrategyLayered branch now sets `req.Runtime.Entrypoint = ports.DefaultLayeredEntrypoint()` unconditionally, dropping the nil-guard that `Normalize()`'s earlier pass could pre-empt — mirroring the static branch's existing unconditional overwrite. `RuntimeConfig.WithDefaults()` itself was left untouched (StrategyExe still legitimately relies on its generic `Entrypoint` default, and no code path anywhere sets a custom entrypoint that this could clobber — verified by grep before making the change unconditional instead of conditional). `tests/integration/strategy_e2e_test.go`'s `TestFixtureDrivenE2E_AllStrategies/layered` subtest was flipped from pinning the buggy exe-shaped entrypoint to asserting the correct `{SupervisorPath, "--", BunBinaryPath, AppServerIndexPath}`.

**Preventative rule:** When one request field's correct default depends on another field of the *same* request (here: `Runtime.Entrypoint`'s default depends on `Compile.Strategy`), never default it inside a generic, strategy-agnostic `Normalize()`/`WithDefaults()` pass that runs before the strategy-aware code path sees the request. Either default it lazily, only once the dependent field is known, or make the strategy-aware defaulting unconditional (never gated on "is it still nil") — a nil-guard silently loses to any earlier generic pass that already claimed the zero value, and unit tests that construct the downstream port request directly (skipping the earlier pass) will never observe the interaction.

## 2026-08-15 — The 4-step verification suite does not run `golangci-lint`, so a CI-breaking `errcheck` finding survived every "green" report

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/mount_test.go`,
`TestMountObserver_ConcurrentRoundTrips_RaceFree` (caught during the final
adversarial review gate, after the feature had already been reported as
verified).

**What happened:** The concurrency test derived each fake response's outcome
from the request's digest via `fmt.Sscanf(..., "%d", &idx)`, discarding the
returned error. `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go build` and `go test ./internal/...
-race` all pass on that line, so every step of `CLAUDE.md` §5's verification
suite reported green — but `.golangci.yml` enables `errcheck`, its
`_test\.go$` exclusion covers only `gosec`/`staticcheck`/`revive`, and
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `golangci-lint run ./...` on every push. The
change would have failed CI on the first run.

**Root cause:** `fmt.Sscanf`'s error was ignored because the happy path was
"obviously" fine — the digests are generated two lines away by the same test.
That reasoning is correct about behavior and irrelevant to the lint gate,
which is what actually blocks the merge.

**Faulty assumption:** that "the CLAUDE.md verification suite is green" is the
same claim as "this change is mergeable." It isn't: the suite covers
formatting, vet, build and tests, and deliberately says nothing about the
linters CI additionally enforces. `HEAD~3` (`chore: fix lint findings…`)
exists precisely because this gap has been walked into before.

**Fix:** Replaced `fmt.Sscanf` with `strconv.Atoi` and returned a transport
error on a parse failure, so an unparseable fixture surfaces as a named
`RoundTrip` error instead of silently defaulting `idx` to 0 (which would have
sent every request down the 201 branch and produced an unexplained summary
mismatch). `golangci-lint run ./...` is now clean repo-wide.

**Preventative rule:** Run `make lint` (or `golangci-lint run ./...`) as a
fifth step alongside `CLAUDE.md` §5's four, before declaring any code change
complete — especially for new `_test.go` files, which people assume are
lint-exempt and which this repo's config only partially exempts. Never report
"verification suite passed" as a proxy for "CI will pass" when CI runs gates
the suite does not.

## 2026-08-15 — Found the same bare-`&http.Transport{}` anti-pattern in 3 places; deliberately fixed only 1 to keep diff scoped

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/registry.go` (fixed), `internal/adapters/baseimage/resolver.go:92` (not fixed), `internal/adapters/remotecacheutils/remotecacheutils.go:432, 725, 766` (not fixed).

**What happened:** While fixing HTTP/2 negotiation on the insecure-TLS path in `registry.go`, a search for `&http.Transport{` literals revealed the same pattern — a bare struct literal instead of cloning from `remote.DefaultTransport` — in three other locations in the codebase.

**Why not fixed:** `resolver.go`'s `insecureTransport` and `remotecacheutils.go`'s three inline `remote.WithTransport(&http.Transport{...})` calls were identified but deliberately left unmodified to keep this task's scope tight. The `registry.go` change (which is on the critical push path) was the priority; the other two modules (base image resolution and cache/pull operations) are separate concerns with different risk profiles.

**Preventative rule:** When a code search discovers the same anti-pattern in multiple places, do not assume "finding one means fixing them all" or vice versa. Be explicit in the code review / task plan about which instances are in-scope and why, so a future maintainer (yourself in 6 months) does not think "we fixed this" means "it's fixed everywhere."

## 2026-08-15 — Upstream's own repo-path math splits "reads" and "chunked-upload writes" into different key shapes; a repo-scoped test double must normalize both onto one key

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/mount_test.go`, `repoScopedBlobHandler`
(the in-memory `(repo, digest)`-keyed blob store backing
`newMountAwareTestRegistry`, used by `push_test.go`'s cross-repo-mount
integration tests).

**What happened:** A prior task flagged, but did not fix, that a real
`remote.Write`-driven push against this harness would store a blob under a
different key than any subsequent read of that same blob would look it up
under — meaning every non-mounted layer (freshly built layers, and the image
config, which is *always* a plain blob) would appear to vanish (`BLOB_UNKNOWN`)
on the very next `remote.Head`/`remote.Image` call. This task's job depended
on that being fixed first, since three of the four planned integration tests
push at least one non-mountable blob.

**Root cause:** go-containerregistry's own in-memory registry
(`pkg/registry/blobs.go`, `blobs.handle`) computes the repo string once per
request as `req.URL.Host + path.Join(elem[1:len(elem)-2]...)` — trimming
exactly the *last two* path segments before rejoining the rest. That produces
the correct repo only when a request's final two segments are
`blobs/<digest-or-"uploads">`, which holds for every read (`GET`/`HEAD`) and
for the mount-initiation POST (`.../blobs/uploads/`, no id yet). The chunked
upload's `PATCH`/`PUT` requests (`streamBlob`/`commitBlob` in
`pkg/v1/remote/write.go`) instead hit `.../blobs/uploads/<id>` — one segment
deeper — so trimming the same "last two" leaves the literal segment `"blobs"`
inside the joined repo string. Every real streamed blob therefore lands under
`"<repo>/blobs"` while every read asks for `"<repo>"`.

**Faulty assumption (in the harness, not this task):** that a single `repo`
string received by a `BlobHandler` implementation is already normalized and
safe to use as a map key verbatim, regardless of which HTTP verb produced it.
It isn't — upstream's *own* path arithmetic is verb-shape-dependent, which is
easy to miss because `isBlob()` (the *routing* predicate, same file) correctly
handles both shapes; only the separate `repo :=` line does not.

**Fix:** Added `normalizeBlobRepo(repo string) string { return
strings.TrimSuffix(repo, "/blobs") }`, applied at the top of
`repoScopedBlobHandler`'s `Get`/`Stat`/`Put`. This is a no-op for the
already-correct shapes (they never end in the literal segment `"blobs"`), so
it unifies both call shapes onto the one true repo key without needing to
know which code path a given call came from. Verified with a regression test
(`TestMountAwareTestRegistry_RealWriteThenReadAgreeOnRepo`) that fails with
`BLOB_UNKNOWN` when the normalization is reverted, and passes with it in
place.

**Preventative rule:** When a test double receives a value that a *third
party's* routing code derived from a URL path via positional slicing (not a
documented, stable API), do not trust that the same logical value comes out
identically shaped across every HTTP verb that routes through it. Grep the
real implementation for every place the value is computed/reused, not just
the one call site the bug report points at — and write the round-trip
regression test (`write` via the real client path, then `read` via the real
client path, against the same identifier) before writing any test that
*depends* on that round trip working, since it is the cheapest possible proof
and pins the fix independently of every higher-level test built on top of it.

## 2026-08-15 — A "mount was declined, so the target should behave exactly like an ordinary push" assumption ignored that a *pulled* `MountableLayer`'s bytes are fetched lazily from its origin

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/push_test.go`,
`TestPush_CrossRepoMount_CrossRegistryRejected` (first draft, caught before
being reported as passing).

**What happened:** The test's first draft asserted that the *source*
registry (server A) must observe **zero** requests while pushing a composed
image to the *target* registry (server B), reasoning that "the client only
ever talks to the registry it's pushing to." That assertion failed on the
very first run: server A recorded one `GET .../blobs/<digest>` during the
push to server B.

**Root cause:** The composed image's mountable layer was obtained via
`remote.Get(refToServerA).Image()`, which wraps every layer in
go-containerregistry's `mountableImage`/`MountableLayer` — but the underlying
`v1.Layer` those wrap is still a *remote, lazily-read* layer: its
`Compressed()`/`Uncompressed()` readers stream from whichever registry it was
pulled from, on demand, rather than buffering the full blob into memory at
pull time. When server B declines the mount, go-containerregistry's
`streamBlob` calls that same lazy `Compressed()` to get bytes to `PATCH` to
server B — and that call has no choice but to reach back out to server A,
the layer's only actual data source. This is not a leak or a bug in
production code; it is the only way a "mount declined, fall back to a normal
stream" path *can* work for content the process never materialized locally in
the first place.

**Faulty assumption:** That "cross-host mount was attempted and declined" and
"the source registry sees zero traffic" were the same claim. They are not —
the correct claim is narrower: the source registry must see no *mount-shaped*
request (no `POST .../blobs/uploads/` — mounting is inherently a
target-registry-only operation), but it will legitimately see reads whenever
the fallback path needs bytes it doesn't already hold.

**Fix:** Replaced the blanket "zero requests" assertion with two precise
ones: (1) no `POST` of any kind reaches server A during the push, and (2) a
`GET` for the specific base-layer digest *does* reach server A, and is
treated as further positive proof of the decline (a successful mount would
require no such read at all, per the sibling
`TestPush_CrossRepoMount_ZeroEgress`, where no such `GET` occurs).

**Preventative rule:** When asserting "no cross-talk between two systems"
in a test, name precisely which *kind* of interaction must be absent (here:
mount-initiation requests) rather than asserting a system is silent overall —
a lazily-evaluated dependency (a remote-backed `io.Reader`, a pull-through
cache, a deferred fetch) can make "silent overall" both false and irrelevant
to the property actually under test. Read what the object you're wrapping
(`*remote.MountableLayer` here) is actually backed by before asserting an
absence of activity on its backing store.

## 2026-08-15 — `http.Transport.Clone()` mutates its receiver, so "clone equals unmodified copy" is not a safe test assertion

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/registry_test.go`,
`TestTransports_PreserveRemoteDefaultTransportTuning` (regression test for
`defaultTransport` / `insecureTransport` in `registry.go`).

**What happened:** While writing a test to assert that `defaultTransport`
(`cloneDefaultTransport(nil)`) has a `nil` `TLSClientConfig` — i.e. "an
unmodified clone of `remote.DefaultTransport`" — the assertion failed even on
a **freshly-called, first-ever** `cloneDefaultTransport(nil)`, before any
network request had been sent by anything in the test binary.

**Root cause:** `net/http`'s `(*Transport).Clone()` is not a pure copy. Its
first line is:

```go
func (t *Transport) Clone() *Transport {
	t.nextProtoOnce.Do(t.onceSetNextProtoDefaults)
	...
}
```

`onceSetNextProtoDefaults` runs **on the receiver `t`** — the transport being
cloned, not the clone — and, when `ForceAttemptHTTP2` is set (true for
`remote.DefaultTransport`), it lazily allocates a `TLSClientConfig` with
`NextProtos: ["h2", "http/1.1"]` if one isn't already set. `Clone()` then
copies that now-populated config onto the new `*Transport` via
`t2.TLSClientConfig = t.TLSClientConfig.Clone()`.

Consequence: the very first call to `.Clone()` on `remote.DefaultTransport` —
which happens unconditionally at `registry` package init, via
`var defaultTransport = cloneDefaultTransport(nil)` — permanently mutates the
shared `remote.DefaultTransport` singleton itself, giving it a non-nil
`TLSClientConfig` from that point forward. "The clone's `TLSClientConfig` is
nil" is therefore not just order-dependent on test execution — it is **never
true**, not even on the first call, because the mutation happens inside
`Clone()` before the copy is made.

**Faulty assumption:** I assumed `.Clone()` on an `http.Transport` behaves
like a value copy with no side effects on the source — reasonable for most
Go structs, wrong for `http.Transport` specifically because of its lazy
HTTP/2 self-configuration.

**Fix:** Replaced the "`TLSClientConfig == nil`" assertion with the
invariant that actually matters for correctness: `defaultTransport`'s
`TLSClientConfig`, whether nil or lazily populated, must never carry
`InsecureSkipVerify: true`. `insecureTransport`'s must always carry it.
Those two properties are stable regardless of `Clone()`'s side effect and
regardless of test execution order within the binary.

**Preventative rule:** When writing a test that inspects the *shape* of a
`*http.Transport` produced via `.Clone()`, do not assert on fields that
`onceSetNextProtoDefaults` can populate lazily (`TLSClientConfig`,
`TLSNextProto`) unless the assertion tolerates that populated state. Assert
on the security- or behavior-relevant *content* of those fields
(`InsecureSkipVerify`, proxy/idle-pool tuning) instead of their nil-ness.
More generally: before asserting "X is an unmodified copy of Y" for any
stdlib type with caching/once-init behavior, check whether the copy
operation itself (`Clone()`, `Do()`, etc.) has documented side effects on the
source — `go doc` and reading the stdlib source directly settled this in
under five minutes and would have prevented writing the wrong assertion in
the first place.

## 2026-08-16 — Multi-platform Static/Layered builds silently collided on a zero-value platform key

**Category:** multi-item / boundary

**Root cause:** In `internal/core/pipeline.go`'s per-platform fan-out
(inside `fanOut`), `art.Platform` was only ever set as a side effect of
calling `deps.Compiler.Compile(...)` — which populates
`compiledArt.Platform` from `CompileRequest.Platform` — and that call only
happens on the `else if !req.Compile.Strategy.ApplyStatic()` branch, i.e.
**only for `StrategyExe`**. `StrategyLayered` (which resolves a Bun runtime
instead of compiling) and `StrategyStatic` (which has nothing to compile —
the SvelteKit build output is the entire artifact) both leave `art` at its
Go zero value, so `art.Platform` stayed `ports.Platform{}` (empty OS/Arch)
for every platform in a Layered or Static build.

Two lines later, `built[i] = platformBuild{artifact: art, image: img}` is
built per platform, and back in `Build`, the map that becomes the packaged
OCI index's platform set is constructed as:
```go
images := make(map[Platform]v1.Image, len(built))
for i, b := range built {
    images[b.artifact.Platform] = b.image
}
```
For a Layered or Static build with more than one requested platform, every
entry collided under the same zero-value key — the last platform processed
silently overwrote all earlier ones in the map, then
`Packager.Index` failed with `packager: index: platform "": unsupported
platform` because `ports.Platform{}.Supported()` is false. A single-platform
Layered/Static build never surfaced this (map has exactly one entry
regardless of its key), which is exactly why it went uncaught: every
existing test exercising `StrategyLayered` or `StrategyStatic` used a single
platform.

**Where:** `internal/core/pipeline.go`, `fanOut`'s per-platform goroutine
(the block setting `art`/`bunResult` around what was originally lines
934–974).

**Fix:** Added `art.Platform = p` unconditionally, immediately after the
strategy branch that may or may not have populated it, so every strategy
(Exe, Layered, Static) gets a correctly keyed `ports.Artifact` regardless of
whether that strategy's branch happens to set `Platform` as a side effect of
some other field it needed anyway.

**Preventative rule:** When a per-platform fan-out loop derives a
downstream map/collection key from a field on a struct that's built up
piecemeal across multiple conditional branches (here: `art.Platform`,
populated only as an incidental side effect of the Exe branch's `Compile`
call), don't trust that every branch populates it — set the key field
explicitly and unconditionally, once, from the loop variable itself. This is
the same failure shape as other multi-item bugs in this codebase: correct
for N=1, silently wrong for N>1, because a single-element collection can't
expose a colliding key. Any test added for a strategy that skips a
per-platform field-populating call (no `Compile`, no `BunRuntime.Resolve`,
etc.) should use `>1` platform specifically to catch this class of bug —
single-platform coverage of a new strategy is not sufficient confidence that
its multi-platform path works.

## 2026-08-17 — A roadmap item's own wording assumed a CLI flag existed that was never actually wired

**Category:** documentation-drift / feature reality check (Row 16 family)

**Root cause:** `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s PB-2 entry read "Any other `--bun-version`
downloads and installs a ~90MB binary with no integrity check at all,"
written as if `--bun-version` were an existing, reachable CLI flag. It
wasn't: `ports.BunResolverRequest.Version` / `core.BunRuntimeOptions.Version`
existed as Go struct fields, and `internal/adapters/bunruntime/resolver.go`
correctly consumed them, but `cmd/pokkum/build.go` and `cmd/pokkum/dev.go`
only ever registered `--bun-binary` and `--bun-variant` — never
`--bun-version`. The original external-review audit that produced this
roadmap entry inferred a CLI surface from the existence of a Go field
without checking whether any flag actually set it, and the entry's own
wording was never checked against `cmd/pokkum/build.go`'s flag list before
being written down as fact.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/build.go`, `cmd/pokkum/dev.go` (missing flag
registration); `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s PB-2 row (the unverified claim).

**Fix:** Added `--bun-version` to both `pokkum build` and `pokkum dev`,
wired to `core.BunRuntimeOptions.Version`, matching the existing
`--bun-binary`/`--bun-variant` pattern exactly. This was found while
building the GPG-signature-verification fix for PB-2 itself (a separate,
correctly-scoped change) — the verification logic was fully correct and
tested, but had zero real CLI attack surface until this flag existed, so the
fix would have silently shipped as library-only/dead-from-the-CLI code
without this second look.

**Preventative rule:** Row 16 of `mem:self_review_checklist` says to grep
the implementing file for the I/O primitive a feature's description
requires before marking something Done. This is the mirror case for
*consuming* a roadmap claim rather than *writing* one: before implementing a
fix for an item that references a `--flag`, grep the actual `cmd/pokkum/*.go`
flag registrations for that exact flag name first — a struct field or port
request parameter existing is not evidence a CLI flag reaches it. A roadmap
entry describing "how a bug is triggered" is itself a claim to verify, same
as a "Done" claim.

## 2026-08-17 — `make verify`'s 5-step suite doesn't cover `tests/integration/`'s own golden fixtures

**Category:** verification-scope / determinism

**Root cause:** Earlier the same day, `internal/adapters/packager/layer.go` and
`internal/adapters/precompressutils/precompressutils.go` were switched from
stdlib `compress/gzip` to `github.com/klauspost/compress/gzip` (closing
PR-1's cross-toolchain gzip framing skew). `internal/adapters/packager/golden_test.go`'s
hardcoded digest constants were correctly re-recorded and `go test ./internal/...`
passed clean. But `tests/integration/golden_test.go` independently pins full
OCI manifest/config/index JSON (`testdata/golden/manifest_linux_amd64.json`,
`config_linux_amd64.json`, `index_multi_arch.json`) against the exact same
underlying compressed-layer-digest-sensitive build path — and `tests/integration/`
is outside `make verify`'s 5-step scope (`./internal/...` + `./cmd/pokkum`
only). The gzip-implementation swap was declared complete, verified, and
committed with these two golden files silently stale; only a later, broader
`go test ./...` sweep (run for an unrelated reason, while working on PB-2/PR-7)
caught it.

**Where:** `tests/integration/golden_test.go` (`TestGoldenOCIManifestAndConfig`,
`TestGoldenOCIIndex`); `testdata/golden/*.json`.

**Fix:** Regenerated both stale golden files with `go test ./tests/integration/...
-run <TestName> -update`, then diffed the result to confirm only compressed-bytes
digests moved (matching the same DiffID-unchanged invariant already verified
in `internal/adapters/packager/golden_test.go`) before committing.

**Preventative rule:** `mem:task_completion` now says explicitly: any change
touching layer compression, tar construction, or OCI manifest/config assembly
must also run `go test ./tests/integration/...` (or a full `go test ./...`),
not just the standard 5-step suite — `make verify`'s `./internal/...` scope is
a deliberate boundary (keeps the fast inner loop fast), not a claim that
nothing outside it can break. The general form of this lesson: a passing
`make verify` proves the tests inside its scope pass, never that no golden
fixture *anywhere in the repo* depends on what changed — when a change is
known to affect a widely-depended-on primitive (compression output, hashing,
serialization format), search the whole tree for other consumers of that
primitive's output before declaring done, not just the package that was
directly edited.

## 2026-08-17 — PR-4's own problem statement ("readiness races the `init` hook") was checked empirically against real adapter-node source and turned out to be false — but the fix was still worth building, for a different reason

**Category:** verify-before-fixing (Row 15/16 family) / no bug found, root cause is a documentation-drift risk avoided

**Root cause:** `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s PR-4 entry claimed "`/readyz` proves only a TCP listener... a pod passes readiness before `init` resolves and takes traffic it cannot serve." Before designing a fix around that claim, it was checked against the real, currently-vendored `@sveltejs/adapter-node@5.5.7` + `@sveltejs/kit@2.70.2` source in `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node/node_modules/`, not assumed. Finding: `index.js` does `import { handler } from './handler.js'` at its top; `handler.js`'s own top-level code does `await server.init({...})` (an ES module top-level `await`); ES module semantics guarantee an importer's own top-level code cannot proceed until every static import's top-level code — including its top-level awaits — has fully resolved. `server.listen()` in `index.js` runs *after* that import line. `@sveltejs/kit`'s `Server.init()` (`src/runtime/server/index.js:108-143`) is exactly where `hooks.server.js`'s exported `init()` hook gets awaited. Chained together: the TCP port literally cannot open before the user's `init()` hook (DB pool setup, cache warming) has resolved — there is no race window for the specific failure PR-4 described. A raw TCP-connect readiness check, which is what `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-init/probe.go`'s `/readyz` already does, was therefore already correct for that specific concern.

Separately, and found while looking at the wider claim: `readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe`/`startupProbe` injection was entirely absent from `internal/adapters/k8s/resolver.go` — not just `startupProbe`, which is all the roadmap item named. The `req.ResourceDefaults`/`req.SecurityDefaults` per-container injection pattern existed for CPU/memory and security context, but nothing generated any probe at all; a user gets probes only if they hand-write `readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe` pointing at the right port in their own Deployment YAML.

**Where:** `testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-adapter-node/node_modules/@sveltejs/adapter-node/files/{index.js,handler.js}`, `.../@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/index.js:56-143` (the empirical check); `internal/adapters/k8s/resolver.go` (the actual, different gap).

**Fix:** did not build a readiness-vs-init race fix, because there is no race to fix. Built `injectContainerProbeDefaults` instead, for the *correct*, still-real reason a `startupProbe` matters here: with only a normal-cadence `livenessProbe`, a legitimately slow `init()` (a slow DB connection, a large cache warm) can get the container killed by kubelet for "failing" liveness before it ever finishes starting and opens its port — `startupProbe`'s `failureThreshold * periodSeconds` grace period (60s by default here) exists specifically to protect a slow-but-healthy startup from that premature kill, and `readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe` don't count against the container until `startupProbe` has succeeded once. Also injected `readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe` themselves, since neither existed either, gated per-probe-type so a container with its own custom `livenessProbe` still gets the other two filled in. `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`'s PR-4 entry is corrected to state the actual verified mechanism, not the originally-assumed one.

**Preventative rule:** matches Row 16's mirror-case extension from the same day's earlier `--bun-version` entry, applied to a technical (not just CLI-surface) claim: a roadmap item's problem statement about a third-party dependency's runtime behavior is an empirical claim, not a given. When real vendored source for that dependency is available in the repo (`testdata/fixtures/...node_modules/...`), read it before designing a fix around the claim — a wrong root cause can still lead to *a* correct-feeling fix (a `startupProbe` genuinely helps here) while completely misdiagnosing *why*, which would have left the doc/comments asserting something false indefinitely. Also folds in Row 15's existing guidance: this is the same "verify the mechanism, don't ship a fix around a plausible-but-unverified hypothesis" discipline, just applied to a framework's documented lifecycle behavior instead of a build-determinism bug.

## 2026-08-17 — Six new `ports.ImageConfig` fields (PB-4) were added to the struct and to base-config parsing but not to `ApplyProfile`'s per-field profile merge

**Category:** multi-item / config-parity (Row 10 family — caught by running the self-review checklist, not by a failing test)

**Root cause:** PB-4 added `Origin`/`ProtocolHeader`/`HostHeader`/`AddressHeader`/`XFFDepth`/`BodySizeLimit` to `ports.ImageConfig` and wired them into base `.pokkum.yaml` parsing (`cmd/pokkum/build.go`'s `projCfg.Image.Origin` read). `internal/adapters/config/config.go`'s `ApplyProfile`, which merges a named profile's `Image` overrides onto the base config, is not generic reflection over the struct — it's an explicit, hand-written list of `if profile.Image.X != zero { merged.Image.X = profile.Image.X }` lines, one per existing field (`Port`, `ProbePort`, `User`, `WorkingDir`, `ShutdownTimeout`, ...). A new `ImageConfig` field is invisible to this merge unless a matching line is added for it — nothing about adding the field to the struct forces that. Undetected because there is no existing test that adds a new `ImageConfig` field and checks it flows through `ApplyProfile`; the omission would have shipped as `profiles.<name>.image.origin: ...` parsing successfully, validating successfully, and then being silently discarded the moment `--profile <name>` was used — the base config's `Origin` (or empty, if unset) would apply instead, with no error or warning anywhere.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/config/config.go`'s `ApplyProfile`, Image-override block (~line 180-219).

**Fix:** added the six missing `if profile.Image.X != zero { merged.Image.X = profile.Image.X }` lines, matching the existing fields' exact style. Confirmed `deepCopyProjectConfig` needed no corresponding change — it starts from a full struct value copy (`dst := *src`) and only needs explicit re-cloning for reference-typed fields (maps/slices/pointers) to avoid aliasing; the six new fields are all plain `string`/`int`, already copied correctly by value. Added `TestApplyProfile_OriginContractFields`, which sets each of the six fields only in a profile (not the base) and asserts they appear in the merged result, plus a same-test check that an empty profile leaves the base value untouched.

**Preventative rule:** this is exactly `mem:self_review_checklist` row 10, re-confirmed rather than revised — the row already existed from a near-identical incident (validation, not merge, that time) and caught this one on the first checklist pass over the PB-4 diff, before any test run surfaced it. Restating the general form since it keeps recurring in this exact area: whenever a field is added to `ports.ImageConfig` (or any struct with a hand-written per-field override/merge/validate function elsewhere, as opposed to generic reflection), grep for every existing hand-written function operating on that struct — `ApplyProfile`, `validateConfigFields`, `deepCopyProjectConfig` — and add the new field to each one that has a reason to touch it, don't assume adding the field to the struct alone is sufficient.

## 2026-08-17 — Explicit `--sbom-attach=referrer` against a referrers-unsupported registry silently landed the SBOM on the wrong, undiscoverable tag — and the one test covering this path was inadvertently validating the bug as correct

**Category:** determinism / fixture-fidelity (Row 12 family) — a real bug found while implementing PR-8 (`--sbom-attach=auto`), not by a failing test

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/registry/sbom.go`'s old `AttachSBOM` referrer-mode branch called `mutate.Subject` + `remote.Write` with go-containerregistry's *default* option set — no `remote.WithReferrersTagFallback(false)`. go-containerregistry's own `remote.Write`, when it detects the target registry doesn't support the OCI 1.1 Referrers API, silently falls back to its own internal tag scheme (`sha256-<hex>`, no suffix) rather than erroring — this is documented behavior in `WithReferrersTagFallback`'s doc comment (go-containerregistry@v0.21.9, `pkg/v1/remote/options.go`), not a bug in that library; it exists so a naive caller doesn't hard-fail. But Pokkum's own SBOM read path (`ports.SBOMTag`, the `<algo>-<hex>.sbom` convention) and `cosign download sbom` both look for the `.sbom`-suffixed tag — go-containerregistry's fallback tag is a *different, unsuffixed* tag, so the SBOM was technically pushed somewhere but invisible to every consumer that knows Pokkum's real convention. This had been true since referrer mode became the default (PR-8's predecessor), on every push to ECR, older Harbor, or older Artifactory.

The only pre-existing test for this path, `TestAttachSBOM_RoundTripReferrer`, used `newTestRegistry(t)` — go-containerregistry's in-process test registry, which (unless explicitly opted in) does **not** support the Referrers API. So this "referrer mode" test was, the entire time, silently exercising the exact silent-fallback path described above and asserting its result was correct — a fixture that happened to share the real bug's triggering condition, satisfying the test instead of catching the bug. This is the same class of gap as Row 12's origin incident (a fixture resembling the real thing closely enough to pass, while not actually modeling what the code path under test needs to prove): here the test registry's *capability*, not its content, was the mismatch with what "referrer mode success" actually requires.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/sbom.go`'s `AttachSBOM` (referrer branch, pre-PR-8); `internal/adapters/registry/sbom_test.go`'s `TestAttachSBOM_RoundTripReferrer` (pre-PR-8, used the wrong-capability test registry).

**Fix:** two independent changes, not one. (1) `remote.WithReferrersTagFallback(false)` is now always set on the referrer-mode push, so an explicit `--sbom-attach=referrer` against an unsupported registry fails loudly (a clear, distinguishable error) instead of silently mis-landing. (2) A new `--sbom-attach=auto` default does its own explicit fallback — on exactly that "unsupported" error, it retries via Pokkum's own `attachSBOMTag` (the real `.sbom`-suffixed convention), not go-containerregistry's incompatible one. Found the gap in the existing test suite while writing the new auto-mode tests, then added `internal/adapters/registry/registry_test.go`'s `newTestRegistryWithReferrers` (`registry.New(registry.WithReferrersSupport(true))`) so a "referrer mode succeeds" test actually exercises a registry capable of it, and repointed `TestAttachSBOM_RoundTripReferrer` at that helper.

**Preventative rule:** extends `mem:self_review_checklist` row 12 — for a test claiming to exercise a registry-capability-gated code path (OCI 1.1 referrers, or any other opt-in registry feature), verify the test double actually has that capability turned on, the same way row 12 already requires verifying a fixture's *content* matches the real pipeline stage under test. A mock/fake that defaults to the *less-capable* configuration will make an explicit "does the advanced path work" test pass by accident, via whatever fallback exists for the less-capable case — silently converting a positive test into a no-op. When adding a new registry-adapter test around a capability flag, grep the test-registry constructor's own options for whether that capability is actually enabled, don't assume "it's a registry, so it must support X."

## 2026-08-18 — Closed the `docker.sock` half of `--hermetic`'s residual mount-namespace gap (opt-in `--hermetic-mount-isolation`) — real, working, and a real bug found in the test's own design along the way

**Category:** determinism/isolation (row 18 family) + a genuinely new test-harness pitfall (process-boundary state, not covered by any existing checklist row)

**Context:** the 2026-08-18 research entry above (this same file) deferred a full fix as "materially riskier engineering" and shipped only the SSH-agent-forwarding half via env stripping. This entry documents actually building the deferred half this same day, once a concrete design existed and dedicated time was allotted for it, per this session's follow-up plan.

**What shipped:** a `/proc/self/exe`-style reexec helper — `internal/adapters/bunexec/hermetic_reexec_linux.go`'s `applyHermeticMountIsolation` retargets a hermetic build subprocess's `*exec.Cmd` to run the current pokkum binary as a new hidden `pokkum __hermetic-reexec` subcommand instead of the real target, carrying the real `Path`/`Args`/`Dir`/`Env` through a JSON payload in one env var (`POKKUM_HERMETIC_REEXEC_TARGET`), and adds `CLONE_NEWNS` to the existing `CLONE_NEWNET|CLONE_NEWUSER` Cloneflags `applyHermeticSandbox` already sets. `RunHermeticReexec` (what that hidden subcommand runs) bind-mounts an empty regular file over each of a small fixed allowlist of sensitive paths (`/var/run/docker.sock`, `/run/docker.sock`) that actually exists, then `syscall.Exec`s into the real target — same PID throughout, so the parent's `cmd.Wait()` still tracks it correctly, and masking is guaranteed to complete before the untrusted `bun` process's own code ever runs (no TOCTOU window: it's sequential code in one process, not a fork boundary). Opt-in via a new `--hermetic-mount-isolation` flag (default off) — deliberately additive, not folded into `--hermetic`'s existing default behavior, since this is genuinely new, previously-unexercised raw-syscall code, unlike the already-proven `CLONE_NEWNET` mechanism.

**Real bug found in the test's own design, not the production code** (caught by actually running the test in a real Linux Docker container, not by inspection): the first version of the empirical test overrode the package-level `hermeticMaskPaths` var directly in the test process to point at a disposable test socket path, expecting the masking to then apply to that path. It didn't — the test's `mount_isolation_blocks` subtest failed with the socket still reachable. Root cause: `hermeticMaskPaths` lives in the `bunexec` package of the **test binary's own compiled process** (`go test`'s binary), but the actual masking runs inside a **separately-compiled real `pokkum` binary** (built via `go build ./cmd/pokkum` specifically so the test exercises the genuine `__hermetic-reexec` subcommand, since `os.Executable()` inside a `go test` binary resolves to the test binary itself, which has no such subcommand). Overriding an in-process Go variable has zero effect on a different OS process's own compiled-in copy of that variable — an obvious fact in the abstract, easy to miss in the moment when a test and the code under test happen to share a package. Fixed by adding a narrow, explicitly test-only env-var override (`POKKUM_HERMETIC_REEXEC_MASK_PATHS_TEST_OVERRIDE`) that `RunHermeticReexec` checks, populated via a small package-level hook (`hermeticMaskPathsTestOverride`) that `applyHermeticMountIsolation` bakes into the constructed `cmd.Env` when set — the same testability-seam pattern already established by `bunruntime.Resolver.ReleaseKeyArmored`. Verified safe from abuse by the sandboxed build dependency itself: `cmd.Env` is replaced outright (not merged with `os.Environ()`), so nothing running inside the sandboxed `bun` process can ever set this variable — only Pokkum's own Go code constructs the reexec'd process's environment.

**Empirical proof, staged to prove the gap AND the fix** (matching this session's own established discipline, not skipped even under time pressure): a real Unix domain socket listener at a real filesystem path, reachable normally (`control_unsandboxed_connects`, PASS); *still* reachable under `applyHermeticSandbox` alone — `CLONE_NEWNET`/`CLONE_NEWUSER` with no `CLONE_NEWNS` (`netns_only_still_connects`, PASS) — this is the direct, positive proof that the gap this feature closes is real, not assumed; then genuinely unreachable once `applyHermeticMountIsolation` runs (`mount_isolation_blocks`, PASS). A further end-to-end test drives the real `Compiler.Prepare` call path with a fake `bun` script probing the same socket, proving the wiring (not just the isolated helper function) works (row 13 discipline). All run for real inside `golang:1.26-bookworm --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` (this session's established real-namespace-test pattern), not just compiled.

**Residual limitation, found during adversarial self-review and stated honestly, not silently shipped as "fully closed"**: the sandboxed `bun` process runs in the *same* user+mount namespace the masking bind-mounts were created in, and that namespace's creator (now the sandboxed process itself, post-`syscall.Exec`) retains `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` *within its own namespace* — the same capability that let Pokkum's own code create the mask in the first place. A sufficiently sophisticated malicious build-time dependency that specifically knows this mechanism exists could in principle call `umount()` on the masked path itself to undo it. This does not apply to `--hermetic`'s existing `CLONE_NEWNET` network isolation — escaping *that* would require `setns()` into a namespace owned by a *different*, more-privileged user namespace (the host's), which the kernel capability-checks against the target namespace's owner, not the caller's own — so the network isolation is robust against this exact class of self-undo in a way the mount masking, as shipped, is not. Closing this fully would mean dropping `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` (via `capset(2)`) from the reexec'd process's own capability sets after masking but before the final `syscall.Exec` — real, additional raw-syscall work (capset's ABI has version-specific quirks) deliberately not attempted in this round, tracked as a concrete follow-up rather than silently left unstated. The baseline this feature actually improves on is still real and meaningful: today, with no barrier at all, *any* build-time dependency can reach `docker.sock` if bind-mounted; after this fix, doing so requires specifically knowing about and defeating this exact mechanism, not just connecting to a well-known path.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/hermetic_reexec_linux.go` (new), `internal/adapters/bunexec/hermetic_reexec_linux_test.go` (new), `internal/adapters/bunexec/hermetic_other.go` (non-Linux stubs), `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Prepare`/`Compile` (both sites, row 18), `cmd/pokkum/hermetic_reexec.go` (new hidden subcommand), `internal/ports/compiler.go`, `internal/core/model.go`/`pipeline.go`, `cmd/pokkum/build.go` (new `--hermetic-mount-isolation` flag).

**Preventative rule:** a new, narrow addition to this project's testing discipline, not an existing checklist row's mistake repeated — when a test needs to exercise code that runs as a *different, separately-compiled OS process* (a reexec helper, a hidden subcommand, anything invoked via `os.Executable()`/`/proc/self/exe`), overriding an in-process package variable does not reach that other process; only environment variables, files, or other genuinely cross-process channels do. Added to `mem:self_review_checklist` as a new row rather than folded into an existing one, since none of the current rows name this failure mode.

## 2026-08-18 — `--asset-overlay`'s merged overlay layer packaged every carried-forward asset one directory level too high, silently defeating the feature — found by the plan's own row-17-style empirical test, exactly as designed

**Category:** multi-item / path-transformation round-trip — a new failure mode, not an existing checklist row's mistake repeated

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/assetoverlay/assetoverlay.go`'s `extractImmutableAssets` pulls a prior generation's `/app/client` layer tar stream and writes each matching entry into a scratch directory (`destDir`) that `packager.go`'s `appendAssetOverlayLayer` later repackages, unchanged, under `ports.AppClientDirPrefix` ("/app/client") again — the same round-trip `BuildDirectoryTreeLayer`/extraction already uses correctly elsewhere in this codebase (e.g. `tests/integration/harness_test.go`'s `ExtractLayerFiles`). The bug: `extractImmutableAssets` computed each file's path *inside destDir* by stripping `immutableAssetPrefix` (`"app/client/_app/immutable/"`) rather than just the client root (`"app/client/"`). That silently dropped the `_app/immutable/` segment from every extracted file's relative path, so `destDir` held e.g. `chunks/gen1-chunk.js` instead of `_app/immutable/chunks/gen1-chunk.js`. Repackaging that under `AppClientDirPrefix` then produced `/app/client/chunks/gen1-chunk.js` in the final image — not `/app/client/_app/immutable/chunks/gen1-chunk.js`, the actual path a browser holding stale HTML requests. The overlay layer built successfully, attested correctly (the attestation digest only checks byte content at whatever path was chosen, not that the path is *correct*), and looked right in every unit-level test — it just served 404s for exactly the request pattern this entire feature exists to prevent.

Undetected by unit tests because `TestExtractImmutableAssets_OnlyImmutablePrefixExtracted` and its siblings only asserted content landed *somewhere reachable* under `destDir` with the right bytes (`destDir/chunks/abc123.js`) — a path shape that happened to match the bug's own (wrong) output, so the fixture validated the bug as correct rather than catching it, the same pattern as `Lessons.md`'s 2026-08-17 `--sbom-attach=referrer` entry (row 12 family) but for a *path*, not a *capability*. `TestAttestationEnv_IncludesAssetOverlayLayer` (this same session, task #87) used a flat filename fixture (`"orphaned-abc123.js"`, no `_app/immutable/` nesting) specifically because `writeStrategyDir` doesn't create nested directories — which meant that test's fixture shape structurally could not have exposed a prefix-stripping bug at all, regardless of how carefully it checked digests.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/assetoverlay/assetoverlay.go`'s `extractImmutableAssets` (the `rel := strings.TrimPrefix(entryName, immutableAssetPrefix)` line).

**Fix:** introduced a distinct `clientRootPrefix` constant (`"app/client/"`) and stripped that instead of `immutableAssetPrefix`, so `rel` retains the full `_app/immutable/...` structure — `destDir` now holds `_app/immutable/chunks/gen1-chunk.js`, and repackaging reproduces the exact real in-image path. Updated the three existing unit tests (`TestExtractImmutableAssets_OnlyImmutablePrefixExtracted`, `_IdenticalContentAcrossGenerationsSkipped`, `_ConflictHardFails`) to assert against the corrected nested path. Found by `tests/integration/asset_overlay_e2e_test.go`'s `TestRealBuild_AssetOverlay_TwoGenerations` — the plan's own designated row-17-discipline empirical test (task #86): two real, sequential `core.Build` calls pushed to a real in-memory registry, generation 2 auto-discovering generation 1's digest via the real `pokkum.dev/predecessor` chain walk, then inspecting generation 2's actually-pushed image's real tar entry names (not a mock's). The first run of that test failed immediately with a clear "orphaned asset not found at the expected in-image path" message; a debug pass (temporarily printing every layer's real tar member names) located the actual path the overlay layer produced (`app/client/chunks/gen1-chunk.js`) and made the missing-prefix bug obvious in seconds.

**Preventative rule:** when a diff extracts content from one packaged location (a tar entry under some prefix) and re-packages it under a *different or the same* prefix later (an extract → scratch-directory → repackage round-trip, not just a plain copy), a unit test that only checks "content landed under the scratch directory with the right bytes, at *some* sub-path" cannot catch a wrong sub-path — it must assert the *exact* relative path the repackaging step will consume, and ideally assert the *final, fully-reconstructed* in-image path a real consumer (a browser, a downstream reader) would request. This is a new, distinct sub-case of Row 17's family (packaged output must actually execute/resolve correctly) specific to two-stage extract-then-repackage transformations — added as a new row rather than folded into 17, since 17's wording is about running an entrypoint, not about a static asset landing at a byte-correct-but-wrong path. Also reinforces Row 12/17's existing point from a new angle: a fixture that avoids the exact nested directory shape the real feature operates on (as `TestAttestationEnv_IncludesAssetOverlayLayer`'s flat-filename fixture did, for an unrelated reason — a test helper limitation) cannot expose a bug that only manifests in that nesting, even when it's otherwise a careful, real test.

## 2026-08-18 — Adversarial review of `--asset-overlay` found and fixed four further real defects: a second ship-blocking attestation bug, a path traversal, a cross-repo functional bug, and two DoS/availability gaps — none caught by the feature's own extensive test suite (including the row-17 empirical test that already caught one bug earlier the same day)

**Category:** multiple — cross-layer record aggregation (new), untrusted-source path containment (new), scope/identity loss across a multi-hop resolve chain (new), unbounded resource consumption from network-sourced content (row 15 family), fail-open-vs-fail-closed inconsistency in a defensive chain-walk

**Context:** immediately after `--asset-overlay`'s implementation passed its full test suite (including the real two-generation empirical test that had already caught one severe bug — see the entry above), this codebase's standing policy (CLAUDE.md §6.3: security-sensitive/registry-trust code gets a final Opus adversarial review before being declared done) was followed as the last step before commit. The review found FOUR further real, independently-confirmed defects — not stylistic nitpicks — none of which the feature's own unit tests, the real two-generation e2e test, or the attestation-inclusion regression test had caught, because each one required either a specific overlapping-path fixture, a specific malicious-input fixture, or a specific cross-repository fixture that no existing test happened to construct.

**Bug 1 — attestation record double-counting on overlay/client path overlap (SHIP-BLOCKING, same severity class as the entry above).** `appendAssetOverlayLayer`'s records were folded into `attestRecords` correctly (the constraint the earlier entry's fix targeted), but `attestutils.RootDigest` has no dedup of its own — it just sorts and hashes whatever list it's given. The asset overlay layer and the current build's own client layer both target `/app/client`, so any path present in **both** (the *ordinary* case: an unchanged content-hashed file keeps the same name across generations, by design) got counted **twice** in the digest, while `pokkum-init`'s runtime walk of the real, layer-squashed filesystem sees the file exactly **once**. Confirmed empirically against a real pushed image from the feature's own e2e flow (stamped digest ≠ runtime-recomputed digest). This would fail startup (exit 126) for essentially every `--asset-overlay` image with any unchanged carried-forward asset — nearly all of them. Existing tests missed it because `TestAttestationEnv_IncludesAssetOverlayLayer`'s fixture used non-overlapping filenames, and the test's own independent oracle (`recomputeLayeredDigest`) mirrored the same non-dedup bug by construction, so it agreed with the buggy code instead of catching it.

**Fix:** `packager.go` now appends the overlay layer's addendum/records **before** the client layer's (so the current build's bytes win the real OCI layer-squash on any collision — belt-and-suspenders, since content hashing should make a real collision impossible), and a new `dedupeAttestRecordsByRel` collapses `attestRecords` to one entry per path (last-wins, matching squash order) immediately before `RootDigest` is called. `recomputeLayeredDigest`'s oracle was rewritten from an appended slice to a `map[string]string` keyed by path (same root-visit order as the real addenda order) so it models the runtime's single-filesystem view instead of the packager's old per-layer bookkeeping. New test `TestAttestationEnv_AssetOverlayOverlapWithClientDeduped` uses the same relative path in both dirs with different content and asserts both the digest and the real extracted tar bytes reflect the current build's content, not the stale overlay's — verified to genuinely fail without the fix (temporarily reverted, ran, confirmed failure, restored) before being trusted.

**Bug 2 — path traversal in `extractImmutableAssets` (HIGH).** The prefix filter (`strings.HasPrefix(entryName, immutableAssetPrefix)`) ran against the RAW, uncleaned tar entry name. An entry like `"app/client/_app/immutable/../../../../pwned.txt"` literally starts with the prefix as a string, passes the filter, and only has its `..` segments resolved *afterward* by `filepath.Join(destDir, rel)` — by which point it had already been accepted, writing attacker-chosen bytes outside `destDir`. This tar content comes from a remote registry, reachable two ways: anyone with push access to the auto-discovered repo (the `pokkum.dev/predecessor` chain), or — with zero push-access precondition at all — an arbitrary `--asset-overlay-from` ref naming any image the operator points it at. Confirmed empirically: a crafted entry wrote a real file outside a real `t.TempDir()`.

**Fix:** `path.Clean` (POSIX-aware — tar names are always `/`-separated) now runs **before** the prefix check, not after — the traversal payload above collapses under `path.Clean` to `"pwned.txt"`, which no longer matches the prefix at all, so the filter itself becomes the primary defense. A second, independent containment check (`safeJoinOverlayPath`, mirroring `tests/integration/harness_test.go`'s existing `safeJoin` helper) verifies the final joined path is still under `destDir` before any write — defense in depth, since the first check's correctness depends on every code path that reaches it staying correct. New test `TestExtractImmutableAssets_RejectsPathTraversal` — verified to genuinely reproduce the traversal (a real file written outside the temp dir) when both fixes are reverted, before being trusted.

**Bug 3 — `--asset-overlay-from` cross-repository refs always 404 and hard-fail the build (HIGH, functional).** `ResolveDigest` returned only the bare digest of a resolved `--asset-overlay-from` ref, discarding which repository it actually resolved in. `BuildOverlayDir`/`ExtractClientImmutableAssets` then always pulled every resolved digest from the **build's own** `req.Repo`, regardless of where `ResolveDigest` found it. Since `--asset-overlay-from`'s entire documented purpose is naming "arbitrary external images, not this build's own push target" (the exact words in `pipeline.go`'s own Stage 4.4 comment), any ref outside the build's own repo resolved fine and then hard-failed on pull with `NAME_UNKNOWN` — directly contradicting the flag's contract. Confirmed empirically: pushed a real image to one repo, built against a different target repo with `--asset-overlay-from` pointed at the first, reproduced the exact `NAME_UNKNOWN` failure.

**Fix:** `ResolveDigest` now returns the fully-qualified `repo@digest` form (`parsed.Context().Name() + "@" + desc.Digest.String()`), not a bare digest. A new `resolveOverlaySourceRef(defaultRepo, source)` helper distinguishes a bare digest (from the chain-walk, always within `defaultRepo`) from an already-qualified ref (from `ResolveDigest`, may name any repo) purely by the presence of `"@"` — a bare digest string never contains one, a qualified ref always does — so `BuildOverlayDir`'s public signature didn't need to change at all. New test `TestAssetOverlayFrom_CrossRepoRefWorks` builds and pushes to two genuinely separate repos and confirms the cross-repo asset actually lands in the target image; verified to fail with the exact original `NAME_UNKNOWN` error when the `ResolveDigest` fix is reverted.

**Bug 4 (two related fixes, same review) — availability/DoS gaps in registry-sourced content handling.** (a) `extractImmutableAssets`'s `io.ReadAll(tr)` had no per-entry size cap, unlike every other place in this codebase reading network/registry-sourced content (`layerdiffutils`, `bunruntime`, `sveltekitutils` all use `io.LimitReader`) — a crafted layer entry could OOM or fill disk. Fixed with a 256MiB cap via `io.LimitReader` plus an explicit post-read size check. (b) `ResolvePredecessorChain` hard-failed the *entire* chain-walk the moment any *later* hop's `pokkum.dev/predecessor` annotation failed to parse as a valid reference — inconsistent with the adjacent not-found/GC'd-predecessor case just above it, which correctly truncates and keeps what it has. Since the annotation is attacker-influenced (same trust boundary as bug 2), one malformed value permanently wedges every future `--asset-overlay` build against that repo — a self-inflicted denial of service. Fixed to truncate on a later-hop parse failure too (only the very first, caller-supplied `repo:tag` parse still hard-errors). Separately, `--asset-overlay=<n>` itself was unbounded before reaching `make([]string, 0, maxDepth)` — a `BuildRequest.Validate()` check now caps it at 1000 and rejects negative values, mirroring the existing `Concurrency`/`PushConcurrency` negative-value pattern. New tests: `TestResolvePredecessorChain_TruncatesOnMalformedPredecessorAnnotation` (verified to fail with a hard error when reverted) and two new `TestBuildRequestValidate` table cases for the generation-count cap.

**Also folded in, same review, no dedicated new test needed (behavioral consequence of bug 3's fix plus a design correction):** `pokkum.dev/predecessor` was being stamped from `assetOverlayDigests[0]` unconditionally, including on the `--asset-overlay-from` branch — but that branch's first entry may name a completely unrelated image in a different repository, which is not what the annotation's own contract documents ("the digest of whatever THIS push replaced at THIS build's own push target"). Predecessor stamping is now gated to only the auto-discovery (`ResolvePredecessorChain`) branch, where `chain[0]` is guaranteed to be the build's own repo's current tag digest. Covered by an assertion inside `TestAssetOverlayFrom_CrossRepoRefWorks` (predecessor annotation must be absent after a pure `--asset-overlay-from` build).

**Where:** `internal/adapters/packager/packager.go` (`dedupeAttestRecordsByRel`, addenda reordering), `internal/adapters/packager/attestation_test.go` (oracle rewrite, new overlap test), `internal/adapters/assetoverlay/assetoverlay.go` (`resolveOverlaySourceRef`, `safeJoinOverlayPath`, `maxOverlayEntryBytes`, `ResolveDigest`, `ResolvePredecessorChain`'s parse-failure handling), `internal/adapters/assetoverlay/assetoverlay_test.go` (new traversal test), `internal/core/pipeline.go` (predecessor-stamping gate), `internal/core/model.go`/`model_test.go` (generation-count cap), `internal/ports/assetoverlay.go` + `internal/ports/cache.go` (doc comments for the qualified-ref representation), `tests/integration/asset_overlay_e2e_test.go` (two new cross-repo/malformed-chain tests).

**Preventative rule:** every one of these four bugs is a NEW checklist row, not a match for an existing one — see `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 21–23 for the general, reusable forms (row 20, added earlier the same day for the path-round-trip bug, is a close cousin of row 21 but a genuinely distinct failure mode — one is about a wrong sub-path, this one is about the same correct sub-path being counted from two sources). The broader, cross-cutting lesson: an extensive, genuinely real test suite — including a full end-to-end empirical test that had *already* caught one severe bug in this exact feature the same day — is not a substitute for a dedicated adversarial pass that specifically hunts for overlapping-input, malicious-input, and cross-scope-input fixtures; ordinary development naturally builds test fixtures that exercise the *intended* input shape, not the deliberately adversarial one, and this feature's own conflict-detection tests (which DO use overlapping/malicious fixtures, just for a different code path) illustrate that the team already knew this pattern mattered — it just wasn't applied to every function handling the same class of untrusted input.


## 2026-08-18 — Git `--since` ref sat before the `--` terminator, letting a crafted ref inject a `git diff` option and write an arbitrary file

**Category:** boundary / injection — untrusted CLI input reaching a subprocess argv without the terminator discipline the rest of the same command already used

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/gitutils/affected.go`'s `AffectedDetector` builds `git diff --name-only <sinceRef> -- .` (plus `git status --porcelain -- .`) to scope monorepo affected-detection to `--since=<ref>`. `verifyGitRef` already ran `git rev-parse --verify <ref>^{commit}` to validate the ref existed — but then discarded that resolved SHA and passed the original, attacker-controlled `sinceRef` string straight into the `diff` command, ahead of the `--` terminator. A ref string starting with `-` (e.g. `--output=/tmp/pwned`) is syntactically indistinguishable from a flag to `git diff` at that position, so `--since='--output=/path'` let `git` write an arbitrary file rather than being treated as a (nonexistent, and thus rejected) revision.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/gitutils/affected.go` — `verifyGitRef`'s resolved SHA was computed and then thrown away instead of being reused by the caller building the `diff`/`status` argv.

**Fix:** `verifyGitRef` now returns the resolved 40-character SHA, and every subsequent git command uses that SHA instead of the raw `sinceRef`. A resolved SHA is hex-only and can never start with `-`, so option injection is impossible by construction rather than by pattern-blocking specific flag shapes. `TestAffectedDetector_InjectionAttack_DashDashOutput`/`_DashO` assert empirically that the attacker's target file is never created; `TestAffectedDetector_LegitimateRefTypes` confirms branch names, tags, `HEAD~N`, short SHAs, and `origin/main` still resolve and work.

**Preventative rule:** when a function already resolves/validates a piece of untrusted input to a safe canonical form (here, `rev-parse --verify` turning a ref into a SHA), reuse that canonical value in every downstream use of the same input — never let validation and use diverge onto two different representations of "the same" value. A validated-but-discarded resolution is a near-miss: the safety check ran, but on a copy nothing downstream actually depends on.

## 2026-08-18 — An early bounds check in `comparator.CompareImages` protected one branch but not the sibling branch that also indexes the same slices

**Category:** boundary — a guard scoped to the success path, not to every branch that touches the same unchecked indices

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/comparator/comparator.go`'s layer-walk compares `remoteDiffIDs[i]`/`localDiffIDs[i]` for each layer index `i`. An existing bounds check (around line 143) covers the case where the diffIDs match and processing continues normally — but a degraded remote image (layers present, but its diffIDs slice shorter than the layer count, with `Uncompressed()` failing on a non-first layer) reaches a *different* branch — the `Uncompressed()`-failure error-handling path — that indexes the same two slices without its own bounds check, because the earlier guard was never in scope for it. The result was an index-out-of-bounds panic instead of a diagnostic error.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/comparator/comparator.go`, `CompareImages`'s layer-walk, the `Uncompressed()`-failure branch following the line-143 guard.

**Fix:** added explicit bounds checking to the failure branch itself, producing a `"diffIDs unavailable"` diagnostic message when the indices are out of range instead of indexing unconditionally. The function was swept for further siblings of the same shape; none were found.

**Preventative rule:** a bounds/nil check written for one branch of a multi-branch function does not protect a sibling branch that touches the same slice indices — when adding or auditing a check like this, trace every branch that reaches the same indexing expression, not just the one the check was originally written for. `mem:self_review_checklist` row 2 ("resource cleanup on every branch") already covers "cleanup runs on every return path"; this is the same discipline applied to bounds/validity checks rather than cleanup.

## 2026-08-18 — The k8s affected-detection goroutine leak was fixed once (checklist rows 1 and 4) and came back in the exact same function — the fix was a guard, not a structural change

**Category:** concurrency / resource-leak — a *recurrence*, not a first occurrence; the checklist row that should have caught it already existed and named this exact function

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/k8s/resolver.go`'s `Resolve` fans out one goroutine per distinct project path to build images, using an `errgroup.Group` and `g.Wait()`. Its `AffectedDetector` skip/reuse check for a given path could error, and that error `return`ed *before* `g.Wait()` — orphaning every goroutine already dispatched for earlier paths in the same loop iteration. Each orphan is a full image build (compile, package, registry push) whose result is silently discarded, and since the CLI exits on command error, the process could terminate mid-push. This is the identical bug class `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 1 and 4 were written for — added after an earlier real goroutine leak in this exact function — and the checklist's own Origin note names this function by path. It regressed anyway, because the previous fix and the checklist row it produced were both *guard-shaped*: "return before Wait is a leak, check for it" is a convention a future edit can violate by construction, not a property the code enforces. Something later re-added detector-check logic interleaved with the dispatch loop, and the convention wasn't there to stop it because conventions don't stop anything by themselves — they only get checked if someone remembers to check them.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/k8s/resolver.go`'s `Resolve`, the per-path loop that both ran `AffectedDetector` skip checks and dispatched `g.Go` builds interleaved in one pass.

**Fix:** split the single interleaved loop into two passes. Pass one runs every path's detector check and skip/reuse decision *sequentially, with zero goroutines in flight* — any error returns before a single `g.Go` call has happened anywhere in the function. Pass two dispatches builds only for the paths that survived pass one, using `errgroup.WithContext` (matching `pipeline.go`'s existing fan-outs) so one failure cancels its peers instead of leaving them running. This makes the leak impossible *by construction*: there is no longer any line of code positioned between a dispatch and its `Wait()` where a fallible call could execute, because all the fallible calls already happened in pass one, before pass two starts. Also fixed in the same pass: `distinctPaths` came from unsorted map iteration (non-deterministic which path's error surfaced, violating the project's determinism invariant) — now sorted.

**Preventative rule:** when a bug recurs in the exact function a checklist row already names, the right response is not "re-apply the same guard, more carefully" — a guard-shaped fix only holds as long as every future edit happens to preserve an invisible invariant ("no fallible call between dispatch and Wait") that nothing in the code enforces. Prefer restructuring so the dangerous shape is *unreachable*, not just currently avoided: if a fallible decision can be fully separated from the goroutines it gates (compute all skip/error decisions first, dispatch second), do that separation explicitly rather than trusting a convention to survive the next refactor. `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 1 and 4 are revised to say this directly, not just to repeat the original guard description.

## 2026-08-18 — Escrow-mirror base images were pulled by a mutable tag, and the digest they were supposed to be pinned to was written to `pokkum.lock` but never read back

**Category:** boundary / tautological check — a pinned identifier resolved through a mutable reference, with the actual pin never enforced

**Root cause:** `pokkum.lock` records a `MirrorRef` (a `"<mirror>:sha256-<hex>"` tag string) and a `Digest` for each escrow-mirrored base image preset. `internal/adapters/baseimage/resolver.go`'s `Resolve` pulled `entry.MirrorRef` — a *tag*, which anyone with push access to the project's own mirror registry can retarget to point at different content at any time — and never compared what the mirror actually served against `entry.Digest`, the value that was supposed to be the pin. `entry.Digest` was written by the mirroring code path and then never read by anything. So the resolved base image's identity depended entirely on trusting the mirror tag at pull time, with no check that it still pointed at the specific content the lockfile had locked. An attacker with push access to the mirror (a much lower bar than compromising the real upstream signer) could retarget the tag at a *different, older, but still genuinely and validly signed* upstream image — e.g. a real prior release with known CVEs — and every downstream check would pass: real Fulcio certificate, correct identity, valid Rekor bundle, matching `docker-reference`. Signature verification alone cannot catch this substitution, because the substituted image really is validly signed; only comparing served-digest-against-locked-digest can.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/baseimage/resolver.go`'s `Resolve`, the `entry.MirrorRef != ""` branch — `entry.Digest` was populated on write but had no corresponding read/compare anywhere in the resolve path.

**Fix:** after a successful mirror pull, the served digest is now compared against `entry.Digest` (when non-empty — first population, with nothing yet locked, still works) and fails closed with `core.ErrBaseSignatureInvalid` naming both digests on mismatch. Resolving via an `@sha256:`-suffixed reference instead was considered and rejected: a substitution would then surface as an ordinary pull failure absorbed by the existing fall-back-to-upstream branch (meant for mirror *unavailability*), silently losing the security signal instead of raising it. The new regression test builds two independently, genuinely signed images, mirrors one, then retargets the mirror tag at the other — reproducing the exact vulnerability before the fix (logs showed the signature verifying and the base image resolving against the substituted digest) and failing closed after it.

**Preventative rule:** a value recorded specifically to pin an identifier (a digest locked in a lockfile, a checksum recorded alongside a download) is not actually enforcing anything unless something reads it back and compares it against the value obtained at the point of use — "written" and "enforced" are different claims, and a field that is only ever written is indistinguishable, in every test that doesn't specifically probe for it, from a field that's doing real work. When a lockfile or pin records a digest next to a *mutable* reference (a tag, a mirror path, an alias), the mutable reference can never be trusted on its own; the pinned digest must be the thing actually compared at resolve time, not merely stored for a human to eyeball.

## 2026-08-18 — Provenance verification's static-key path was a literal fail-open: `SignatureValid: false` with a `nil` error, so `pokkum verify`'s rebuild/comparison path had no gate on the signature result at all

**Category:** boundary / silent-degradation — a false result reported through a channel indistinguishable from a genuinely-checked-and-failed result

**Root cause:** while removing the shared placeholder trust-anchor key (see the "escrow-mirror" and Roadmap 2h entries), each of the three sites that used to fall back to it was checked individually for what happens with no key configured. The base-image and remote-cache sites already surfaced an explicit error in that case. `internal/adapters/provenance/resolver.go`'s `ResolveProvenance` did not: with no static key configured and a static-key Cosign signature present on the image, `verifyCosignSignature` simply left `out.valid` at its zero value (`false`) and returned no error. The caller — `pokkum verify`'s rebuild/comparison path — only ever checked `err != nil`, never `summary.SignatureValid` on its own, so a `nil` error meant "proceed as normal," and the build silently proceeded through its rebuild/comparison logic having applied *no* gate on signature validity whatsoever — for a genuinely, validly signed image. `SignatureValid: false, err: nil` is byte-for-byte indistinguishable, to any caller checking only `err`, from "everything checked out." This was found not by reading the code but by applying the same "does this fail closed with no key configured?" proof to this site that had already been applied to the other two, and discovering the proof didn't hold here.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/provenance/resolver.go`'s `verifyCosignSignature`/`ResolveProvenance` — the static-key branch when `len(pubKeyPEM) == 0`.

**Fix:** added a `staticSigSeenNoKey` field to the internal `sigVerifyOutcome` struct (mirroring the existing `keylessMaterialSeen` pattern for the keyless path), set when a static-signature annotation is present but nothing is configured to check it against. `ResolveProvenance` now checks this flag and returns a new sentinel error, `ErrStaticKeyRequired`, naming `--public-key`/`POKKUM_SIGNING_PUBKEY`/`POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY`, instead of silently resolving to `SignatureValid: false` with no error.

**Preventative rule:** a verification function that can conclude "nothing was actually checked" must never report that outcome through the same success/failure shape (`valid bool, err error`) as "checked and failed" — collapse the three real states (valid / invalid / nothing-to-check-against) into two observable ones and the caller loses the ability to tell "there was no signal here" from "the signal said no," which is exactly the distinction a security gate needs. When auditing a set of parallel call sites for the same defect class (as here, checking three independent trust-anchor sites for fail-closed behavior), don't stop after confirming the pattern at the first site or two — a `false, nil` fail-open at one sibling site can hide behind superficially similar-looking code at the others.

## 2026-08-18 — `dev --watch` died after exactly one rebuild because a buffered result channel was reused across container generations

**Category:** concurrency — cross-generation state reuse with no owner, making correctness depend on which write won a race

**Root cause:** `cmd/pokkum/dev.go`'s `watchAndRunDevContainer` used one buffered channel, captured by closure, to receive each running container's exit result. On a file-save rebuild, `cancelContainer` killed the *old* container; that container's own goroutine then woke up and wrote its now-stale "signal: killed" result into the *same* channel the *new* generation's select loop was about to read from. Because only the per-container context had been cancelled — not the loop's own outer context — `ctx.Err()` was `nil` when that stale value was read, so the code had no way to tell "this is the old generation's leftover result" from "the new generation just failed," and reported "container exited with error," tearing down the entire dev loop after a single successful rebuild. No test exercised this function at all before this fix, so the flagship interactive dev loop shipped with a bug that reproduced on literally the second file save, every time.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/dev.go`, `watchAndRunDevContainer` — one channel variable shared across the rebuild loop's iterations instead of being scoped per generation.

**Fix:** each generation now gets its own channel, created fresh and passed as a parameter into that generation's goroutine rather than captured by closure. This makes correctness independent of timing: a superseded generation's eventual write lands in a channel the new generation's select loop was never given and will never read from, so it cannot be mistaken for the current generation's result regardless of how the race resolves — draining-and-reusing the old channel would only have been correct when the wait happened to win the race, which is exactly the kind of "usually works" bug this class of fix is meant to eliminate. The blind 500ms sleep that had been acting as an unstated synchronization point was replaced with a bounded wait for the old generation to actually exit. Testing this required introducing a seam (`devContainerRunner`/`devBuilder` interfaces over the previously-unmockable Docker calls, mirroring `upgrade.go`'s existing `releaseFetcher` pattern) — the new regression test drives two full rebuild cycles and was confirmed to fail against the pre-fix loop body with the exact originally-reported symptom.

**Preventative rule:** a channel, buffer, or other mutable piece of shared state that's meant to carry exactly one generation's result must be scoped to that generation explicitly (created fresh, passed as a parameter) rather than captured once and reused across a loop that spawns a new async producer each iteration — "the old producer's write just lands somewhere nobody reads" is a property you get by construction from per-generation ownership, not from being careful about drain timing on a shared buffer.

## 2026-08-18 — `pokkum upgrade`'s binary self-replacement retried an identical rename after deleting the installed binary, which cannot succeed for the deterministic reason the first attempt failed

**Category:** resource-leak / destructive-retry — retrying an operation with no changed precondition, on a path that had already destroyed the fallback

**Root cause:** `cmd/pokkum/upgrade.go`'s `replaceBinary` removed the currently-installed binary and then retried the same `os.Rename` that had already failed once. The most common real failure mode is `EXDEV` — the new binary lives in a temp directory that fell back to `os.TempDir()`, which can be on a different filesystem than the install target — and `EXDEV` is not a transient condition; retrying the identical rename against the identical two paths fails identically every time. Because the old binary had already been removed before the retry, a failed retry could leave the machine with **no pokkum binary at all**: not the old one (deleted), not the new one (rename failed again).

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/upgrade.go`, `replaceBinary`.

**Fix:** replacement is now rename-aside (move the existing binary to a backup path) → rename-in (move the new binary into place) → restore-on-failure (if rename-in fails, rename the backup back into place) → an `EXDEV`-specific copy-then-remove fallback (`renameOrCopyFile`) when a plain rename can't work at all. If even the restore step fails, the error names the sidelined backup path explicitly so a human can recover it manually — the failure mode is now "you're told exactly which file to restore," not "you have nothing and no clue why." File mode is preserved from the existing binary via `Chmod` on the already-open file handle rather than a hardcoded `0755` applied by path after the fact, which also closes a symlink race (the path-based chmod could apply to something other than what was just written, if a symlink at that path changed between the write and the chmod). Same commit also capped `upgrade`'s `io.ReadAll` calls (including the pre-verification archive download) at the same limits `bunruntime` already uses (1MB metadata, 512MB archive) — previously a compromised or MITM'd asset host could exhaust memory *before* the checksum/signature check that was supposed to gate trust ever ran. The signature-then-checksum-then-extract ordering was re-verified intact: nothing on the install path runs before both checks pass.

**Preventative rule:** before retrying a failed filesystem operation verbatim, ask whether anything about its inputs or environment actually changed between attempts — if the failure was deterministic given the same two paths (a cross-device rename, a permissions error, a nonexistent parent directory), a bare retry will fail identically and is pure wasted risk if the retry sits after a destructive step that already removed the fallback. Prefer stage the destructive step last, or make it reversible (rename-aside instead of delete) so a failure anywhere in the sequence still leaves a recoverable state.

## 2026-08-18 — The Bun runtime, `pokkum-init`, and `pokkum-static` layers took their tar timestamp — and on-disk cache key — from `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, even though their content never depends on it

**Category:** determinism — a build-input knob leaking into an artifact whose content is independent of that input

**Root cause:** `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` defaults to `git log -1 --pretty=%ct`, the timestamp of the last commit — which changes on every commit, by design, since most layers' *content* genuinely reflects the source snapshot at that commit and should timestamp accordingly. But the Bun runtime binary (~90MB, fetched/cached by version+variant+platform, not derived from the project's source at all) and the `pokkum-init`/`pokkum-static` supervisor binaries (built once per Pokkum release, not per user commit) do not vary with the user's commit history — yet `internal/adapters/packager` stamped their tar `ModTime` from the same `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` as every content-derived layer, and `layercacheutils`' on-disk cache key included that `modTime` too. The result: byte-identical binary content produced a *different* layer digest on every commit, which defeated both the local on-disk layer cache (a miss every single build, for a layer whose bytes never changed) and registry-side deduplication across a fleet (every image built from a different commit shipped its own distinct ~90MB Bun blob instead of sharing one). docs/Roadmap.md had called Bun-layer stability "the single biggest size lever available" — this bug meant it was actively working in the opposite direction. The item that led to this fix was originally framed as "add a test asserting the diffID is stable"; writing that test found the diffID was not, in fact, stable, turning a test-writing task into a bug fix.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/packager` (the four layer-build call sites for the Bun runtime, `pokkum-init`, and `pokkum-static`) and `internal/adapters/layercacheutils.ComputeKey` (its `modTime` parameter).

**Fix:** those four layer builds now use a fixed `pinnedImmutableBinaryEpoch` constant instead of `req.SourceDateEpoch`. Every other layer — server, client, vendor, native, prerendered, and the `exe` strategy's compiled app binary — still derives from `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, because that content genuinely does reflect the source snapshot; the split is documented in the packager package comment so the boundary is explicit rather than implicit. `layercacheutils.ComputeKey` drops its `modTime` parameter entirely (rather than being called with a constant everywhere), making the invariant structural — a future caller can't accidentally reintroduce timestamp-sensitivity into the cache key, because the parameter allowing it no longer exists. Startup attestation was confirmed unaffected two ways: `attestutils.RootDigest` hashes only `<relpath>\x00<sha>` with no `ModTime` anywhere in its input, and these three specific layers never feed `attestRecords` in the first place.

**Preventative rule:** before wiring a build-input knob (a timestamp, a flag, an environment variable) into every layer/artifact uniformly, check whether each artifact's *content* actually depends on that input. A knob that legitimately varies some artifacts (source-derived content, correctly keyed to the commit that produced it) can still be wrong to thread into a sibling artifact whose bytes are independent of it (a pinned third-party binary, a project-independent toolchain component) — uniform plumbing is convenient but not automatically correct, and the cost of getting it wrong here was fleet-wide deduplication silently and completely defeated.

## 2026-08-18 — A regression test asserted the supervisor layer's timestamp equals `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` — which was the bug, not a check for its absence

**Category:** multi-item / test-encodes-the-bug — the test's own assertion enshrined the behavior that needed fixing

**Root cause:** while the previous entry's bug (immutable-binary layers deriving their timestamp from `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` instead of a fixed epoch) was live, `tests/integration/e2e_test.go` contained an assertion checking that the supervisor layer's tar timestamp *equalled* `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`. That assertion was not a neutral bystander — it was actively pinning the buggy behavior in place: any fix that changed the supervisor layer to use a fixed epoch instead would make this exact test fail, meaning the test suite would have actively resisted the correct fix rather than merely failing to catch the original bug. A green test suite is normally read as "nothing regressed"; here, a green result on this specific assertion was direct evidence of the bug's presence, not its absence.

**Where:** `tests/integration/e2e_test.go`, the supervisor-layer timestamp assertion.

**Fix:** the assertion was corrected to check that the supervisor layer's timestamp equals the new fixed `pinnedImmutableBinaryEpoch`, with the app layer's timestamp still separately asserted against the real build epoch (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`) alongside it — so the test now distinguishes the two timestamp domains explicitly instead of assuming they're the same value.

**Preventative rule:** when a test asserts an exact equality against a value derived from current production behavior (rather than against an independently-reasoned expected value), ask whether the assertion is checking a *specification* or merely *transcribing whatever the code currently does* — the latter looks identical to real coverage until the behavior it transcribed turns out to be the bug, at which point the test becomes an obstacle to the fix instead of a safety net for it. This is distinct from `mem:self_review_checklist` row 12's fixture-fidelity family (which is about a fixture's *content* not matching the real artifact) — here the fixture was accurate to what the code did; the assertion's *expected value* was simply wrong on the merits.

## 2026-08-18 — A content-addressed cache key made the new Bun-layer stability test vacuous: a shared cache would return the first build's bytes on the second build regardless of whether the fix worked

**Category:** determinism / test-substance — a test environment side effect that can make an assertion pass unconditionally

**Root cause:** the regression test added alongside the immutable-binary-epoch fix builds real images twice under two different `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` values and asserts the immutable-binary layer's diffID is unchanged while the app layer's diffID does move. But once the fix made the on-disk cache key content-only (dropping `modTime`, per the fix described above), a *second* build with the same underlying content would simply hit the local cache and return the *first* build's cached bytes outright — meaning the assertion "the diffID holds across two epochs" would have passed whether or not the timestamp-pinning fix was actually present, because the second build's own compilation step was never given the chance to prove anything; the cache short-circuited it. The implementing agent caught this during test design, before it shipped as a false-positive-shaped test.

**Where:** the new regression test for `pinnedImmutableBinaryEpoch` (`internal/adapters/packager/immutable_binary_timestamp_test.go`).

**Fix:** the test isolates `POKKUM_CACHE_DIR` per build (a fresh temp directory for each of the two epoch-varied builds), so each build's layer construction genuinely runs rather than serving a cached result from the other run.

**Preventative rule:** when a fix changes a cache key to be *more* permissive about what counts as a hit (here: content-only instead of content+timestamp), any test asserting stability/determinism *across* multiple builds of "the same" content must confirm each build actually re-executed the code path under test, not that a shared cache silently absorbed the second invocation — isolate on-disk/process-level caches per test run (a fresh `POKKUM_CACHE_DIR`, a fresh temp directory) whenever the cache's own hit criteria could otherwise make two intentionally-varied invocations collapse into one. This is a specific instance of `mem:self_review_checklist`'s general "does the test actually exercise what it claims to" family, worth calling out on its own because a passing cache hit and a passing real recomputation are indistinguishable from the assertion's point of view.

## 2026-08-18 — The runtime smoke test leaked a Docker container on a failed run, because cleanup was registered only after a successful `docker run`

**Category:** resource-leak — cleanup ordered after the very call whose failure the cleanup exists to handle

**Root cause:** `tests/integration/runtime_smoke_test.go`'s new end-to-end smoke test (`TestRuntimeSmoke_LayeredStrategy_BootsAndServes`, added to prove a packaged image actually boots and serves — see the "packaged output must actually execute" checklist row) registered its `t.Cleanup` for removing the test container only after a `docker run` call had returned successfully. But `docker run -d --name X` *allocates and registers* the named container object as its first step, before attempting to start it — so a run that failed partway through (the exact case a test written to catch real breakage is most likely to hit) still left a named container registered with the Docker daemon, with nothing in the test ever cleaning it up. This was found while deliberately proving the test *could* fail (rewriting the built image's entrypoint to a nonexistent path to confirm the smoke test would catch it) — running that negative case surfaced the leaked container as a side effect of exercising the failure path for the first time.

**Where:** `tests/integration/runtime_smoke_test.go`, the section running `docker run` for the built test image.

**Fix:** cleanup is now registered unconditionally, immediately after issuing the `docker run -d --name <name>` call, rather than after confirming it succeeded — matching the actual allocate-then-start semantics of what Docker does under the hood, instead of the "cleanup follows success" shape that would be correct if the call were atomic.

**Preventative rule:** `mem:self_review_checklist` row 2 ("resource cleanup on every branch") already asks whether cleanup runs on every return path — this is a sharper instance of the same principle: when the call being cleaned up after is not atomic (it *allocates* a resource as a distinct, earlier step from *using* it, as `docker run`'s container-creation-then-start sequence does), cleanup must be registered as soon as the allocating step happens, not after the step that can fail partway through an already-allocated resource. Check what the external tool's actual failure semantics are — "the call returned an error" does not always mean "nothing was created."

## 2026-08-19 — The embedded PID-1 binaries were gitignored local artifacts that no CI job or release pipeline built, so `--strategy=static` shipped non-functional from every release and the supervisor itself was built outside its own attested pipeline

**Category:** boundary / build-pipeline gap — a `go:embed` target with no producer in the pipeline that ships the binary consuming it

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/staticserver` and `internal/adapters/supervisor` consume `pokkum-init`/`pokkum-static` via `go:embed all:bin`, populated only by `make supervisor`/`make static-server`. Both binary directories are gitignored (`.gitignore:15,18`) — only `.gitkeep` is tracked, confirmed with `git archive HEAD`. `go build ./cmd/pokkum` embeds an almost-empty directory without complaint (embedding a near-empty directory is legal Go), so the gap produced no compile-time signal and surfaced only at runtime, when a provider looked for a blob that wasn't there. Nothing in `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, or `slsa-builder.yml` ran either make target. `.goreleaser.yaml`'s before-hook ran `make supervisor` but not `make static-server`, so every previously-published release embedded a working supervisor but no static-server binary at all — `--strategy=static` could never have functioned from a release binary, independent of the bind/Preflight/flattening bugs fixed the same night. Until this was caught, the PID 1 running in every produced image (not just static) was built on whichever developer's machine happened to run `make supervisor` locally, outside the CI pipeline whose SLSA provenance describes a hermetic build — for a supply-chain tool, the sharpest possible irony: the binary that enforces the startup attestation was itself the one component the attestation's own build pipeline never touched. A prior commit message in this same session claimed the blobs were checked-in artifacts and had just been regenerated in place; `git add` on a gitignored path silently no-ops, so that claim was never true, and the `docs/archive/overnight-findings.md` entry describing it had to be corrected after the fact.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/staticserver/bin/`, `internal/adapters/supervisor/bin/` (gitignored, `go:embed all:bin` consumers); `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/workflows/slsa-builder.yml` (no build step for either target); `.goreleaser.yaml` (before-hooks missing `make static-server`).

**Fix:** `static-server` added alongside `supervisor` in the goreleaser before-hooks, and a `Build Embedded PID-1 Binaries` step (`make supervisor static-server`) added to all three CI jobs. Deliberately not fixed yet, tracked on `docs/archive/Roadmap.md`: nothing asserts the embedded blob actually *is* a fresh build of its own source rather than a stale local one a developer forgot to rebuild before committing — the CI/release fix closes "nothing builds it" but not "the thing that builds it might be stale."

**Preventative rule:** an embedded or otherwise pipeline-external artifact (`go:embed`, a vendored binary, a checked-in generated file) consumed by production code must be built by the *same* pipeline that ships the binary consuming it — a compiler that happily embeds an empty or stale directory gives no signal that the producer step is missing, so absence-of-error is not evidence of presence. Grep every `go:embed` target in the codebase and confirm something in CI and in the release pipeline actually produces each one. For a supply-chain-security tool specifically, always ask whether the component that *enforces* attestation is itself covered *by* that attestation — here it was not, for the entire prior history of the static strategy.

## 2026-08-19 — The embedded Sigstore trust root was already rejecting valid signatures as forgeries, not merely approaching staleness, and the true fix required distinguishing "our anchor doesn't cover this" from "this signature is bad"

**Category:** boundary / silent-degradation — a security control that reports the wrong diagnosis for its own inability to check, and a stale trust anchor treated as a documentation problem when it was already a live one

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/sigstore/trusted-root-public-good.json` was captured 2026-08-12 from `sigstore-go`'s own bundled example, itself a pre-2023 snapshot: newest anchor dated 2023-04-14, covering exactly one Rekor transparency log, with an already-expired (April 2024) TSA leaf. The live public-good trust root has covered a *second* Rekor log (`log2025-1.rekor.sigstore.dev`) since 2025-09-23. Any keyless Cosign signature recorded on that second shard failed verification against the embedded snapshot with `not enough verified log entries from transparency log: 0 < 1` — a message that reads exactly like a forged signature, not an out-of-date trust anchor. This was not a future risk being pre-empted: it was already live, because keyless verification itself had only recently become genuinely functional (the certificate-derived-identity fix), meaning the stale trust root had never yet been load-bearing but was about to be the very next real signature it saw. Investigating this also surfaced that `sigstore-go`'s own bundled example (the thing this package's README instructed maintainers to re-copy on refresh) is itself the same stale artifact — so the documented refresh procedure would have reinstalled the exact bug being fixed.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/sigstore/trusted-root-public-good.json` (the stale snapshot); `internal/adapters/sigstore/README.md` (the refresh procedure that pointed back at the stale source).

**Fix:** shipped as a hybrid rather than either single option the roadmap had posed. The snapshot is regenerated from the raw, TUF-signature-verified `trusted_root.json` target fetched directly from Sigstore's TUF repository (`internal/adapters/sigstore/tufrefresh.go`), reproducible across independent fetches. An opt-in TUF client (`FetchTrustedRootJSON`/`ResolveTrustedRootJSON`, `TUFOptions`) can refresh live, but is not the sole answer — a TUF-only approach would put network I/O on a path (`Verify`) that must work air-gapped, and `sigstore-go`'s own embedded `root.json` had itself expired 2026-06-22, so a TUF-only client cannot even bootstrap offline. Three guards now stop this specific failure mode from recurring silently: an always-on age/expiry test (`TrustedRootMaxAge` = 180 days, `TrustedRootExpiryWindow` = 90 days) that fails in CI rather than warning; a network divergence test comparing the embedded anchor set against the live repository in both directions, which *skips* (never fails) when the repository is unreachable, so flakiness cannot get it disabled; and a digest tripwire (`trusted-root-metadata.json`'s `SHA256`) catching the snapshot and its provenance sidecar drifting apart. The refresh path is `RefreshTrustedRootCommand` — the exact same test, run with `POKKUM_UPDATE_SIGSTORE_TRUSTED_ROOT=1`, following Go's golden-file `-update` convention, so the code that *detects* divergence is the same code that *fixes* it and the two cannot disagree. Verification itself (`Verify`) remains fully offline — `FetchTrustedRootJSON` refuses before constructing a TUF client at all when `Offline` is set, wrapping `core.ErrHermeticViolation` the way `bunruntime` does. Operationally, the most important part of the fix is diagnostic, not corrective: an unknown Rekor log still fails closed with an unchanged verdict, but the error now says this is most likely a trust-root coverage gap (naming the logs the embedded snapshot *does* cover) rather than implying a bad signature — proven by reverting the message change and watching only the diagnosis, not the verdict, regress.

**Preventative rule:** any embedded trust anchor or pinned security snapshot needs (1) a machine-readable capture date recorded alongside the bytes, (2) an always-on test that *fails* (not just warns) once the snapshot is older than a deliberately-short-of-actual-key-lifetime threshold, and (3) an error message that distinguishes "our anchor does not cover this" from "this artifact is bad" — the two require completely different operator responses, and collapsing them trains people to distrust a working security control or to bypass it. Before trusting a third-party module's own bundled "example" trust material as a refresh source, verify it is actually current — a module's example fixture is not guaranteed to track its own dependency's live state, and it wasn't here.

## 2026-08-19 — `Preflight` again made an independent, untested assumption about the target adapter that a same-day fix to `Prepare` had already generalized — the exact recurrence checklist row 13 exists to catch

**Category:** boundary — a caller in the same real call chain making its own untested assumption about an input a sibling function had already been fixed to handle correctly

**Root cause:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`'s `Preflight` hard-required either `@jesterkit/exe-sveltekit` or `@sveltejs/adapter-node` and had no `Strategy` field on `ports.PreflightRequest` to consult, so it rejected every correctly-configured `adapter-static`-only project *before* `Prepare`'s own strategy-aware adapter check — which genuinely does branch on strategy — ever ran. This is structurally the same defect `mem:self_review_checklist` row 13 was written for: a well-tested fix to one function in a real call chain (`Prepare`'s strategy dispatch) left the chain broken end-to-end because an earlier check in the same chain (`Preflight`, called by `core.Build` ahead of `Prepare`) made its own independent, untested assumption about the same input. Row 13 already named this exact function pairing from a prior incident and still did not prevent the static strategy from shipping unbuildable for real projects, because nothing forced a fresh grep of `Preflight`'s callers when the static strategy was added — the row's discipline has to be re-run per new strategy, not treated as satisfied once.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`, `Preflight`; `internal/ports` (`PreflightRequest` had no `Strategy` field to thread through).

**Fix:** `Strategy` threaded from the one production caller into `PreflightRequest`; `Preflight` now picks its required adapter with the same positive switch `Prepare` uses (`switch req.Strategy { case ports.StrategyStatic: ...; default: ... }`), not a negative "not X" check — a negative check had already silently swallowed the default strategy once elsewhere in this codebase, which is why the positive form is the house convention. `PreflightResult.AdapterVersion` had the same latent bug (it always resolved against `@jesterkit/exe-sveltekit` regardless of strategy) and was fixed in the same pass.

**Preventative rule:** row 13's discipline (grep the fixed function's real callers for independent, untested assumptions about the same input) is not a one-time fix to apply once and consider closed for that code area — it must be re-run every time a new enum value (here, a new `ports.BuildStrategy`) is added to a dispatch that a sibling function in the same call chain also independently branches on. A checklist row that already named the exact function pairing and still didn't prevent the second occurrence is evidence the row needs to be actively re-applied on every strategy/enum addition, not evidence the row is ineffective.

## 2026-08-19 — The synthetic static-strategy fixture fabricated the same flat `prerendered/index.html` shape the buggy production code assumed, so the one test exercising it passed against a fiction (row 12 recurrence)

**Category:** multi-item / test-encodes-the-bug — a fixture's content matching a bug's wrong assumption rather than the real artifact it stands in for

**Root cause:** real `@sveltejs/adapter-static` output nests prerendered routes under `prerendered/pages/` (and, per the vendored `@sveltejs/kit` source, two further sibling categories, `dependencies` and `data`, that every real adapter's own `writePrerendered` flattens together) — there is no top-level `prerendered/index.html`. Production code (`internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go`, ~line 436) assumed a flat tree, so its existence check passed (the directory was present) while every prerendered route 404'd at runtime. `tests/integration/static_e2e_test.go`'s `staticFixtureCompiler` fabricated exactly that same flat shape rather than the real nested one, so `TestFixtureDrivenE2E_Static` exercised the code's own wrong assumption and passed throughout — this is precisely `mem:self_review_checklist` row 12's failure mode (a fixture whose content agrees with the bug instead of the real upstream artifact), recurring in a new package after already being named as a pattern from an earlier `handler.js`-bundling incident.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/bunexec/compiler.go` (the flat-tree assumption); `tests/integration/static_e2e_test.go`'s `staticFixtureCompiler` (the fixture that fabricated the same assumption).

**Fix:** a new `FlattenPrerenderedOutput` function reproduces the real three-category flattening (`pages`/`dependencies`/`data`) in a fixed, deterministic order, tolerating missing categories and hard-failing on a cross-category path collision rather than silently overwriting. `staticFixtureCompiler` now models the real nested shape and calls the production flatten function itself instead of reimplementing an assumption — so it can no longer drift back into agreeing with a bug in that function, structurally, not just by present intent. Fixing the fixture surfaced a further, independent bug: it reused one shared fixture directory across runs, so a second `Prepare` collided with the first run's already-flattened leftovers; it now resets the output directory the way `adapter-static`'s own real `builder.rimraf` does. The real fixture that caught all of this (`testdata/fixtures/sveltekit-static`) was scaffolded and built with real tooling specifically because no real static-strategy fixture existed before this — only the synthetic compiler had ever exercised this path.

**Preventative rule:** `mem:self_review_checklist` row 12 already covers this exact shape ("a mock can encode the same wrong assumption as the bug it's meant to catch") — this incident is evidence the row's coverage needs to be actively re-checked whenever a new strategy or adapter integration is added, the same way row 13's recurrence (above) shows for caller-chain coverage. A fixture that models production's *assumption* about an upstream tool's output, rather than the upstream tool's *actual* output (verified by scaffolding and running the real tool, as this fix finally did), cannot distinguish the code being correct from the code being wrong in exactly the way the fixture agrees with.

## 2026-08-19 — Deleting the last adapter→adapter import edges exposed two latent fail-opens in provenance verification, reachable only once the default they had been hiding behind was gone

**Category:** boundary / silent-degradation — a nil-tolerant condition that read as a harmless guard while a default made the nil branch unreachable, and became a fail-open the moment that default was removed

**Root cause:** while emptying `internal/architecture_test.go`'s adapter→adapter allowlist (moving `cosign.NewSigner`/`sigstore.NewVerifier` construction from adapter-level defaults into `cmd/pokkum`'s composition root), `internal/adapters/provenance/resolver.go` was found to contain a `case r.signer != nil:` with no `default` arm, and a `&& r.keyless != nil` folded into what was meant to be a material-presence test — plus `tryParseAndVerifySLSA` returning a bare `false` for a nil DSSE signer. While a verifier default was always constructed, these nil branches were provably unreachable and read as ordinary defensive guards. With the default deleted, each one silently *skips* verification instead of refusing: the first two produce `SignatureValid: false` with a **nil error** for a genuinely signed image — indistinguishable from "checked and passed" to any caller that only checks `err`; the third yields `HasProvenance: false`, which is load-bearing for `--expect-source`'s gate. This is the third distinct instance of the identical `false, nil`-indistinguishable-from-working shape found in this codebase within roughly 24 hours (the escrow-mirror digest gap and the static-key fail-open both preceded it), which is itself the signal that this is a systemic class, not three unrelated bugs.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/provenance/resolver.go` — the `case r.signer != nil:` switch with no `default`, the `&& r.keyless != nil` presence check, and `tryParseAndVerifySLSA`'s nil-signer path.

**Fix:** a new `verifierMissing` field on the internal `sigVerifyOutcome` struct (mirroring the existing `keylessMaterialSeen`/`staticSigSeenNoKey` pattern) tracks "nothing was configured to check this," and `ResolveProvenance` now refuses via a new `ErrVerifierNotInjected` instead of silently resolving to a passing-shaped false. The SLSA path returns a fatal error rather than a bare `false` for a nil DSSE signer. Each was confirmed the same way the static-key fail-open was: by reintroducing the deleted default and watching the new tests print the exact fail-open shape verbatim, then removing it again and confirming the tests fail closed.

**Preventative rule:** a nil-tolerant condition that reads as a defensive guard is a fail-open already waiting, the moment whatever made that nil branch unreachable (here, a required default) is ever removed — "it currently can't happen" is not the same claim as "it's handled correctly if it does." Whenever deleting a default/fallback anywhere in a dependency-injection chain, grep every `== nil`/`!= nil` test on that field across the whole package, not just the one call site the removal was aimed at, and confirm each one *refuses* the operation rather than silently *skipping* it. This generalizes `mem:self_review_checklist` row 30's proof technique (reintroduce the removed fallback, watch the test fail) into a search discipline for finding every site that needs the proof in the first place.

## 2026-08-19 — `pokkum-static` never set `http.Server.Addr` on either listener, so every `--strategy=static` image was unreachable on its documented ports, invisible because every existing test used `httptest`'s own listener

**Category:** resource-leak-adjacent / untested-real-path — a real network bind path with zero coverage because every test substituted a different listener entirely

**Root cause:** `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-static/main.go` constructed both the content `http.Server` (~line 74) and the probe `http.Server` (~line 95) without ever setting `Addr`. With `Addr` empty, Go's `ListenAndServe` falls back to the wildcard address on port 80 (`:http`) for *both* servers — they raced for the same port, one winning and the other dying with "address already in use" — so `PORT`/`POKKUM_PROBE_PORT` were parsed correctly and then never actually applied to the bind call. `main_test.go`/`integration_test.go` only ever exercised the handlers through `httptest.NewServer`, which supplies and owns its own listener regardless of what `Addr` production code sets — so no test in the repository had ever invoked the real `ListenAndServe` path for this binary, at all, before the new adapter-static fixture's boot smoke test did. Confirmed directly against the real binary: built and run with `PORT=3000 POKKUM_PROBE_PORT=8081`, `lsof` showed a bind on `*:80`, curl to 3000/8081 failed, curl to 80 succeeded. In the real target container this bug would not even have manifested as "wins port 80" — binding below 1024 needs `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, which a distroless uid-65532 PID 1 does not have, so the real failure mode in production would have been an immediate bind-permission crash rather than a working-but-wrong port.

**Where:** `supervisor/cmd/pokkum-static/main.go`, both `&http.Server{...}` literals.

**Fix:** `Addr` is now set from the already-correctly-parsed config on both servers via two small builder functions, extracted specifically to make the real bind path unit-testable. The host part is deliberately left empty (the wildcard address) — inside a container network namespace, the Pod/Service only ever reaches the process through the runtime-attached interface, never loopback, so anything narrower would be unreachable from outside. New tests bind a real listener on an ephemeral port and issue a real TCP request, rather than going through `httptest` — proven to actually exercise the fix by temporarily neutering the `Addr` assignment and watching the new tests fail with `content.Addr = "", want ":<port>"`.

**Preventative rule:** `httptest.NewServer` (or any test helper that substitutes its own listener/transport) can make a real `ListenAndServe`/bind-configuration code path permanently untested while every test using that helper stays green — this is a specific, sharper instance of `mem:self_review_checklist` row 17's "packaged output must actually execute" discipline, applied to network binding rather than packaged file contents: if the only tests touching a server's startup path go through a substitute listener, add at least one test that binds a real port and connects to it over real TCP before considering that startup path covered.

## 2026-08-19 — the live-registry tripwire's `cannot reach registry` skip guarded only the cheap manifest fetch, so a mid-pull TCP reset was reported as an upstream format change

**Category:** boundary / test-infra — a guard placed at the first network call in a test body rather than at every network call in it

**Root cause:** `TestTripwire_LiveDistroBaseImages` exists to fail loudly when upstream distroless images change format. It guards against being run offline with `t.Skipf("cannot reach registry (offline/sandboxed): %v", err)` on the result of `remote.Image(ref)` — but `remote.Image` fetches only the *manifest*, a few kilobytes. The multi-megabyte layer download happens one line later, inside `scannerutils.ExtractImagePackages`, whose failure was a bare `t.Fatalf`. So the reachability precondition was proven on the cheapest call in the test and then assumed to hold across the expensive one, where essentially all of the bytes and all of the transient-failure risk actually live. Observed in a full-suite run as `tar read error: read tcp 192.168.1.196:65227->74.125.133.82:443: read: connection reset by peer`. This matters more than an ordinary flake because W3 added a non-`-short` CI job, which is exactly where this test now runs: a transient reset in GitHub Actions would block merges while reporting the failure as "upstream changed its image format".

**Where:** `internal/adapters/scanner/tripwire_test.go`, `TestTripwire_LiveDistroBaseImages`.

**Fix:** a new `isTransientNetworkErr` classifies transport failures (`net.Error`, `*net.OpError`, `syscall.ECONNRESET`/`EPIPE`, and `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` for a reset that the gzip/tar layers have already re-wrapped) and the extraction step now skips on those, while any other error still fails. `scannerutils` wraps with `%w`, so the transport cause stays reachable through its own `tar read error:` wrapper. The classifier is unit-tested in **both** directions — deliberately, because the two mistakes have asymmetric cost: too narrow merely restores the flake, whereas too broad would make the tripwire silently skip the real format change it exists to catch, converting a correctness gate into a fail-open. The "not transient" cases therefore pin that a wrapped *format* error (`tar read error: malformed tar header`) and a clean `io.EOF` both still fail.

**Preventative rule:** a `t.Skip` that encodes an environmental precondition ("offline", "no Docker", "no Bun") must be evaluated against *every* operation in the test that depends on that precondition, not just the first one — proving a precondition on a cheap probe and then letting a later expensive operation fail hard is the same shape as checking a permission at open time and assuming it holds for every subsequent write. When adding or reviewing such a skip, list every call in the test body that touches the guarded resource and confirm each is covered. Additionally: any predicate that decides *skip vs. fail* is load-bearing safety logic and must be tested in both directions, since over-broad "this is just environmental" classification silently disables the gate rather than breaking it visibly.

## 2026-08-19 — a bulk path-rewriting sweep changed a filename *argument* as if it were a *reference*, redirecting generated output into docs/docs/archive/

**Category:** boundary / mechanical-refactor — a textual sweep applied to every occurrence of a token without distinguishing the roles that token plays

**Root cause:** retiring twelve hand-maintained status docs into `docs/archive/` meant repointing ~103 inbound references across markdown, Serena memories, instruction files and Go comments. That was done with a scripted regex sweep over the filenames. The sweep is correct for a *reference* — prose or a comment naming a document — but `scripts/gen-docs/main.go` contained `filepath.Join(docsDir, "Roadmap.md")`, where the identical string is an *argument naming the file to create*, not a reference to the moved one. Rewritten, the generator would have written its roadmap to `docs/docs/archive/Roadmap.md`. A second instance of the same confusion: `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/telemetry.go` embeds a `console.error` string that surfaces in the *user's own application console inside a container*, where no repository-relative path can resolve at all — the sweep dutifully "corrected" it to a path that is meaningless in that context, and the pre-existing text was already wrong for the same reason.

Neither reached a commit: both were caught by reading the sweep's own diff before staging. The generator bug would have been caught by `make check-docs-freshness` shortly after; the runtime-message one would not have been caught by anything, because no test asserts that string and no human reads a container log during CI.

**Where:** `scripts/gen-docs/main.go`'s `writeFile(filepath.Join(docsDir, ...))`, and `internal/adapters/sveltekitutils/telemetry.go`'s `metricsOnly` warning.

**Fix:** the output-path argument restored to `"Roadmap.md"`; the runtime warning now names the flag's documentation rather than any file path. Separately, the retire exposed that moving files one directory deeper silently broke 38 links which had been correct relative to the repository root — nothing regenerates archived files, so the dead-link walker was extended to cover `docs/archive/`, and taught to percent-decode so it stops rejecting the correctly-encoded link to `Supply Chain Hardening v1.md`.

**Preventative rule:** before running any bulk textual sweep over a token that names a file, symbol, or route — a path migration, a rename, a flag deprecation — classify the occurrences by *role* first, not by *file type*: a reference (prose, comment, doc link) may be rewritten mechanically, whereas an argument or literal that *constructs* the thing (an output path, a create/open call, an embedded template, a struct tag, a wire-format key) must be inspected individually, because there the old string is still correct. Grep the candidate set for the token appearing inside a string literal passed to a filesystem, network, or template call and hand-review every hit. Then read the sweep's entire diff before staging — a sweep that compiles and passes tests can still be wrong in exactly the places tests don't look, and a string that only ever reaches an end user's console at runtime is the least-covered place of all.

## 2026-08-19 — a `replace` directive that looked like it substituted x/crypto's openpgp applied to nothing at all

**Category:** boundary / false-assurance — a configuration line that reads as an enforced guarantee while silently matching nothing

**Root cause:** `go.mod` carried `replace golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp => github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto/openpgp v1.4.1`, which reads unambiguously as "x/crypto's unmaintained openpgp is swapped for the maintained fork everywhere." It was inert. Go's `replace` operates on **module** paths, and `golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp` is a *package* inside the `golang.org/x/crypto` module — it has never been a module of its own. `go list -m golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp` answers "not a known dependency", and dropping the directive changed `go.mod` by two lines and `go.sum` by nothing whatsoever, which is the proof that it was doing no work.

The substitution was nevertheless real, but for an entirely different reason than the directive suggested: the source imports `github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto/openpgp` directly and never imports the x/crypto package. So the desired end state held by convention, with nothing enforcing it — a single stray import (habit, autocomplete, a well-meaning contributor "fixing" an unresolved symbol) would have reintroduced the unmaintained package while the directive sat in `go.mod` implying that was impossible.

**How it surfaced:** pushing to the now-public repo triggered a Dependabot alert. `govulncheck` resolved it to GO-2026-5932, whose text *is* "the golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp package is unmaintained, unsafe by design, and has known security issues", with `Fixed in: N/A` — there will never be a fixed version, because the remediation is not using the package. The alert fires at module granularity: `golang.org/x/crypto` legitimately remains in the graph for unrelated primitives (`sha3`, `cast5`, `argon2`, `chacha20`, `ssh`, …), so a module-level scanner cannot see that the one offending package is unused.

**Where:** `go.mod`'s sole `replace` directive; the real mechanism in `internal/adapters/bunruntime/resolver.go`.

**Fix:** dropped the inert directive and replaced decoration with enforcement — `internal/architecture_test.go`'s new `TestBannedImportsAreAbsent` walks every first-party source root (including `tests/` and `scripts/`) and fails on any import of a banned path, carrying the reason in the failure message. Proven by adding a file that imports the banned package and watching the test name it, then removing it. The walker also fails loudly if it scans zero files, so a future layout change cannot make it silently blind.

**Preventative rule:** a configuration directive is not a control until something fails when it is violated. Whenever a build file appears to enforce a project decision — a `replace`, an override, an exclusion, a resolution pin, a lint disable scoped to a path — verify it actually binds to something (`go list -m` the target, delete the line and diff the resolved graph or lockfile; a no-op deletion that changes nothing is the tell) and then move the guarantee into a test that fails on violation. Corollary for module-granularity vulnerability alerts: "we replaced that package" and "no code imports that package" are different claims with different evidence, and only the second is checkable — check the second.

## 2026-08-19 — `pokkum init` wrote a config `pokkum build` refused, and the binary already contained the validator that would have caught it

**Category:** boundary / seam-untested — two independently-correct halves with nothing exercising the join, in the one place a first-time user meets the tool

**Root cause:** `GenerateDefault` wrote `sbom.attach: attestation` into every generated `.pokkum.yaml`. `attestation` was never one of that mode's values (`referrer`, `tag`, `auto`) — it is a plausible word, because an SBOM genuinely *is* attached as an attestation, which is exactly why it survived review. `pokkum build` then refused to start: `invalid sbom attach mode`. The first two commands a new user runs, back to back, did not work together.

Both halves were individually correct and individually tested. `GenerateDefault` had tests asserting its fields. `ParseSBOMAttachMode` had tests rejecting bad input. Neither knew about the other, so a value satisfying *neither* contract sat in the generated config indefinitely. Worse: `cmd/pokkum/config.go`'s `validateConfigFields` already checks `sbomAttach` — the binary shipped a validator that rejects exactly this, and `init` simply never ran it on its own output.

Found by the maintainer running the tool on a real project, not by any test, review pass, or agent — after this same session had shipped six waves of hardening across signing, verification, caching and secret scanning.

**Two further defects the regression test then surfaced immediately:** the interactive prompt offered `chainguard-static`, which is an unimplemented roadmap item rather than a preset (so option 3 produced a config `build` rejects), while omitting `distroless-node`, which is real; and the prompts accepted whatever was typed, verbatim, so any typo reached disk and failed much later at a distance from its cause.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/config/config.go`'s `GenerateDefault`; `cmd/pokkum/init.go`'s `promptInitOptions`.

**Fix:** the generated values now come from the port's own constants (`ports.DefaultSBOMAttachMode`, `ports.SBOMFormatSPDXJSON`), so this class of typo is a compile error rather than a runtime one. `init` validates what it is about to write through the same `validateConfigFields` the `config validate` command uses, and refuses with an explicit "this is a bug in pokkum, not your project" — a generated config is Pokkum's own output, so an invalid value there is never the user's fault. `promptChoice` constrains each enum answer to a fixed set and re-asks instead of accepting, and the base-preset list is now exactly the presets that exist.

**A near-miss worth recording, because it nearly became a fake test:** the first attempt to verify the prompt fix piped answers to the real binary and observed a valid config — which proved nothing. `init` only prompts when stdin is a TTY, so piping skips prompting entirely and every value stays at its default. The "passing" observation was measuring the default, not the validation. Caught by asking what result would distinguish the two: feed an invalid answer followed by a *valid, non-default* one, and check the non-default value survives. The real test drives `promptInitOptions` through its injected reader instead.

**Preventative rule:** whenever code *generates* input for another part of the same system — a scaffolded config, a default manifest, a template, a fixture, an emitted flag — assert in a test that the generated artifact is accepted by the very validator or parser the consuming path applies to it, across the whole matrix of choices the generator can make, not just its defaults. Individually testing the generator's fields and the parser's rejections leaves the seam untested, and the seam is where the value nobody validated lives. Corollary: if the system already contains a validator for that artifact, the generator must *run* it rather than merely coexist with it — a validator not invoked on the output it governs is a control the codebase only appears to have (see row 43). And when verifying an interactive path, first establish that the path under test actually executed: a value that matches the default proves nothing about validation, so make the expected outcome differ from the default.

## 2026-08-19 — `pokkum init` closed by recommending a command it had just guaranteed would fail

**Category:** boundary / seam-untested — the same class as the entry above it, one level up: the artifact that failed to compose was *advice* rather than data

**Root cause:** `init`'s first prompt offers the registry as "empty for local only". Accepting it leaves no destination repository, and `pokkum build` defaults to push mode, so it refuses to start with `destination repository is required in push mode`. `init` nevertheless ended with a hardcoded `You can now run `pokkum build``, so the tool recommended a command it had itself made unusable, for the option it had itself presented as reasonable. `pokkum build --local` worked the whole time — it clears configuration entirely and reaches real preflight.

Reported from a real first run *minutes after* the generated-config fix landed, in the same three-command sequence. Two distinct defects, same seam, found the same way: by running the commands rather than testing them individually.

**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/init.go`'s completion message.

**Fix:** the closing line is derived from the config `init` wrote — or loaded, when one already exists, so re-running on a configured project gives advice about that project rather than about defaults. It also lands in the JSON envelope as `next_command`, so scripted callers and humans get the same answer from one source.

The guard is the part worth copying: a workflow test reads the recommendation out of `init --output=json` and then *runs it*, instead of hardcoding a command. Change what `init` suggests and the test checks the new suggestion automatically. It deliberately does not assert success — the fixture has no JS toolchain — only that the recommended command never fails for a configuration or usage reason, which is the actual claim being made.

**Preventative rule:** treat user-facing next-step advice as an artifact under the same obligation as generated config: whatever the tool tells the user to run must work given what the tool just did, and the two are written in different places and drift. Any "you can now run X", "try Y", or printed remediation command should be produced from the state that was actually configured rather than as a constant, exposed in machine-readable output so it has exactly one source, and covered by a test that executes it. Prefer a test that *reads* the advice over one that restates it — restating it copies the assumption instead of checking it, and both copies then drift together.

## 2026-08-19 — three of four guards for a filesystem race passed with the fix reverted, and the fix itself was wrong twice before it was right

**Category:** concurrency / test-substance — a guard that cannot fail, compounded by an observable that could not see the change it was measuring

**Root cause of the bug:** `fanOut` builds platforms concurrently and every platform packages from the same output tree, so one platform generated precompressed sidecars while another was already walking that tree into a tar. `os.WriteFile` truncates before writing, so a walker could stat a half-written sidecar, take the partial size into its tar header, then read the finished file and overrun it — `archive/tar: write too long`. Intermittent, and `-race` cannot see it because the race is mediated by the filesystem rather than memory.

**Root cause of the wasted work, found while fixing the above:** `isStale` compares a sidecar's mtime against its source's, but sidecars were `Chtimes`'d to the build epoch while a build writes its sources *now* — so every sidecar was permanently "older than its source" and every platform re-ran brotli at BestCompression over the whole tree. That is what made the race window maximal rather than vanishing.

**Where:** `internal/adapters/precompressutils/precompressutils.go`; called from three sites in `internal/adapters/packager/packager.go`, all of which discarded the error.

**Fix:** the sidecar's on-disk mtime now comes from its source, which makes freshness meaningful (safe for reproducibility: the only `ModTime` reaching a tar header is the pinned value `writeTar` receives, verified — on-disk mtimes never influence image bytes). A per-directory lock serialises precompressors. Together these give the real invariant: **writes never overlap a walk**, because the first platform writes while the others are blocked, and every later platform then finds the sidecars fresh and writes nothing, so all writing finishes before any tar starts. The three discarded errors now warn.

**Two wrong turns, both worth keeping:**

*Atomicity as the fix.* Temp-file-plus-rename looked strictly better and is wrong here: `os.CreateTemp` puts the temporary file in the very directory the packager walks, so a concurrent walk either fails its lstat when the file is renamed away or packages a `.tmp-*` file into the image. A test caught it. The fix had to be ordering, not atomicity.

*A test asserting the wrong guarantee.* Having chosen ordering, a test that forces continuous rewrites during a walk asserts atomicity — a guarantee deliberately not provided — and duly failed intermittently. Deleting it was correct; keeping it would have been a flaky test of a property we chose not to have.

**The part that actually cost the most:** four test designs, and the first three passed with the fix reverted. Two concurrency tests could not hit a window about one syscall wide. Worse, the freshness test compared sidecar *mtimes* — and because the broken code pinned every sidecar to the same epoch, a rewrite set exactly the mtime it already had, so the test could not distinguish "reused" from "regenerated" and passed either way. Replacing the observable with a content canary — overwrite each sidecar with a marker, see whether the marker survives — turned it into a guard that fails 12/12 when the fix is reverted.

**Preventative rule:** for every guard added with a fix, revert the fix and confirm the test fails, and treat a test that still passes as no guard at all — this is already row 30's technique, extended with the reason it is not optional: three plausible-looking tests here proved nothing. When a test cannot fail, first suspect the *observable* rather than the interleaving: ask what value the buggy code and the fixed code would each produce, and if they are identical (a timestamp the bug pins to a constant, a size that does not change, an error that is swallowed) choose a different observable — content canaries, inode identity, call counts — instead of adding retries or sleeps. And for a filesystem-mediated race specifically: `-race` is silent, the vulnerable window may be a single syscall wide, so prefer testing the *invariant the design maintains* (here: writes finish before any walk starts) over trying to observe the absence of a rare interleaving. State plainly in the test file which guarantees are and are not provided, because the next reader's instinct will be to add the test that was correctly deleted.

## 2026-08-19 — A phantom-flag guard scoped to one surface let the same class recur through another

**Category:** boundary / guard-scope
**Root cause:** `actionyml_test.go` was written *because* `action.yml` shipped invoking `--repo` and `--tag`, neither of which existed. It guards `action.yml`. Nothing checked flag names embedded in Go string literals, so the identical mistake reappeared in `pokkum init`'s completion advice ("Set docker.repo … (or pass `--repo`)") — the one message whose entire job is telling a first-time user what to run next. The guard was scoped to the *surface* where the bug was first seen rather than to the *class* of claim ("a flag name we tell a user to type must exist"), which relocates the next occurrence instead of preventing it.
**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/init.go:232` (the mention); `cmd/pokkum/actionyml_test.go` (the guard that could not see it)
**Fix:** `cmd/pokkum/flagmentions_test.go` — `TestFlagMentionsInUserFacingStringsExist` walks the cobra command tree (116 flags, including ones reachable only via nested subcommands such as `base update --mirror-registry`) and checks every flag-like token in a string literal in non-test files under `cmd/` and `internal/`. Proven to fail on the original wording, naming `init.go:232`, and on a plausible typo (`--signing-keys`).
**Secondary finding, same commit:** the guard's foreign-tool allowlist was first seeded from an earlier ad-hoc scan that had included test files and comments. Of 40 entries, **26 were dead** — and one of the dead entries was `--repo` itself, which would have made the guard permanently blind to the exact reintroduction it exists to catch. Two of the "foreign" entries (`--fast`, `--perturb`) were in fact real Pokkum flags on `repro doctor`, i.e. the allowlist was asserting Pokkum does not own names it does own. `TestFlagMentionAllowlistHasNoDeadEntries` now fails on any entry that is unmentioned or that has become a real flag.
**Preventative rule:** When writing a guard after an incident, state the class of claim being guarded and ask which *other* surfaces can express that same claim; a guard naming one file guards one file. And an allowlist admitted into a guard must be proven minimal by a test, because a dead entry is a pre-authorised blind spot — never seed one from a scan that was not scoped exactly as the guard is. See `mem:self_review_checklist` row 46.

## 2026-08-19 — A docker-gated test kept a stale expectation invisible through a full "green" suite

**Category:** verification-gap
**Root cause:** `cd5c7f0` gave the shared dropped-annotations warning builder (`registry.go:355`) a trailing clause naming which `pokkum.dev/*` annotations carry build metadata. That builder has three call-site expectations; the two in `tarball_test.go` were updated, `daemon_test.go`'s was not. It stayed green because that test skips on `!dockerAvailable(t)` and no daemon was running when the change was verified — so the suite reported green on an assertion that never executed. It surfaced only when Docker came up for unrelated manual testing, a day later and on a commit that had nothing to do with it.
**Where:** `internal/adapters/registry/daemon_test.go:186`; builder at `internal/adapters/registry/registry.go:355`
**Fix:** updated the expectation to the current message; re-ran with a live daemon (all three `Daemon`-gated tests execute, 0 skips).
**Preventative rule:** A change to a *shared* message/format builder must enumerate every call-site test, and for each ask whether it is environment-gated — a gated test cannot vouch for an expectation it never evaluated, so "suite green" is a claim only about the tests that ran. When a diff touches such a builder, run the gated tests with the precondition satisfied (start the daemon, install the toolchain) before declaring the change verified, or state explicitly which assertions were skipped. Row 39 already required a skip guard to *cover* every dependent operation; this is the complementary failure — the guard worked correctly and the cost was paid in unverified expectations.

## 2026-08-19 — A dead linter silently disabled the whole CI gate; then its replacement passed green while testing nothing

**Category:** verification-gap
**Root cause:** Three instances of one class — *a verification surface reporting success while executing nothing* — found in a single sitting, each one layer beneath the last.
1. `golangci-lint` was pinned to `v1.62.2` with `install-mode: binary`. That prebuilt binary is compiled with go1.23, and golangci-lint refuses a config whose target Go version exceeds its own build version, so against `go.mod`'s 1.26.6 it exited 3 with `can't load config` — never linting a file. This began at the Go bump, not at any lint change.
2. Because that failed at the *step* level, GitHub skipped every later step in the job: govulncheck, architecture purity, the scoped race detector, the full test suite with coverage, the coverage floor, and the CLI build. Only "Upload Coverage Profile" ran, because it alone carried `if: always()`. **CI had been red for at least six consecutive runs on `main` while running zero tests**, which is also why nothing caught the stale `daemon_test.go` expectation logged above.
3. The fix's own new step — hermetic tests in a privileged container — then reported success while both mount-isolation tests *skipped*: `git` inside the container rejects the bind-mounted workspace as dubiously-owned, so `go build ./cmd/pokkum` failed, and `realPokkumBinary` converts that into `t.Skipf`. Local verification missed it because the repo is owned by my own UID there, so git worked and the test genuinely ran.
**Where:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint step, six following steps, hermetic container step)
**Fix:** `install-mode: goinstall` at v1.64.8, so the linter's Go version equals the module's by construction and cannot break on the next Go bump (`go.mod` untouched — raise the linter, never lower Go); `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}` on all six following steps so one broken step can no longer disable the others; `-buildvcs=false` in the container step. Verified: 15/15 steps execute, and 14 Hermetic tests pass with 0 skips — including two mount-isolation tests that had never executed in any environment.
**Preventative rule:** A green check is a claim about *what ran*, never about what passed. For any verification step, ask what it prints when it does nothing, and make "did nothing" impossible to confuse with "found nothing": assert a floor (`N tests ran`, `M files scanned`), and treat `ok`/exit-0 from a step whose body can `t.Skip` as unverified. In CI specifically: a failing step skips its siblings by default, so a single infrastructure break can retire the entire gate silently — put `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}` on independent verification steps so each reports for itself. And pin a linter/analyser by *how it is built*, not only by version: a prebuilt binary carries its own Go version and will reject a newer module target. See `mem:self_review_checklist` row 47.

## 2026-08-20 — Three of four documented install paths were broken on a public repo

**Category:** boundary / guard-scope
**Root cause:** The README offered four install methods and only Homebrew worked. `install.sh` was never committed, so `curl …/main/install.sh | sh` 404'd; `setup-pokkum@v1` named a ref that has never existed (only full versions are tagged); `npx @pokkum/cli` named a package that was never published, because the release pipeline's npm step failed on both releases. This is the `--repo` phantom-flag class one level up — telling a user to run something that cannot work — and the guard written for that class could not see any of it, because `flagmentions_test.go` scans Go string literals and these were claims in Markdown. Row 46 was written days earlier and says to enumerate every surface that can express the claim; it was not applied here.
**Where:** `README.md` install section; `cmd/pokkum/flagmentions_test.go` (the guard that could not see it)
**Fix:** `install.sh` written with SHA-256 verification against the release's `checksums.txt` (tested against the real v1.0.1 release, and the refusal path tested by corrupting the archive post-download); action pinned to `@v1.0.1`; npm marked unpublished with the caveat required to appear before the first runnable mention. `cmd/pokkum/readme_install_test.go` now checks raw file URLs resolve to committed files, `uses:` refs resolve to real tags, and the unpublished package is not presented as working — each proven by reproducing the original bug.
**Preventative rule:** Deliberately offline, so the guard cannot flake — which leaves a gap that is stated in the test rather than hidden: a claim about an *external* registry cannot be verified locally, and that is exactly what broke with `@pokkum/cli`. When a guard is scoped for determinism, write down which claims fall outside that scope, or the scope silently becomes the definition of "checked". See `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 46 and 48.

## 2026-08-20 — A floating version pin resolved differently per platform and broke the build

**Category:** verification-gap
**Root cause:** Bumping `actions/setup-go` to a major that sets `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` turned `go-version: '1.26'` from harmless into fatal: with `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` Go will not fetch a newer toolchain to satisfy `go.mod`, and the macOS runner resolved `'1.26'` to **1.26.5** against a `go.mod` requiring ≥ 1.26.6. The breaking change *was* researched before the bump, and the research reached a confident wrong conclusion — the version manifest's newest 1.26.x was 1.26.7, so `'1.26'` "must" satisfy 1.26.6. What a floating pin resolves to is per-platform and per-runner-image, so that inference was never sound. No local check could catch it: the YAML parsed, and the constraint only exists on a runner.
**Where:** `.github/workflows/*.yml` — ten `setup-go` steps across seven workflows
**Fix:** all ten now use `go-version-file: 'go.mod'`, taking the version from the single source of truth. This also makes the never-downgrade-Go rule mechanical rather than remembered: CI cannot run an older toolchain than the module declares.
**Preventative rule:** When a pin can be expressed as "read it from the declared source of truth" instead of a floating range, prefer that — a floating minor is an *environment-resolved* value, and reasoning about what it will resolve to is not verification. Corollary found in the same session: a guard of mine failed in CI because `actions/checkout` fetches no tags, so `refs/heads` was populated while `refs/tags` was empty and the code read "some refs exist" as "tags are available". Both are row 47's last clause — local verification is not evidence for CI precisely when the thing that differs is what the check depends on. See row 48.

## 2026-08-20 — A detached HEAD made committed work look like it had never happened

**Category:** process
**Root cause:** Building the npm package required the tree at `v1.0.1`, so an isolated `git worktree` was used specifically to avoid disturbing `main`. Somewhere in that sequence the *main* working tree was checked out to the tag anyway — the reflog records only the outcome (`checkout: moving from main to v1.0.1`), not the command. Every tracked file silently reverted to v1.0.1's content, and files that exist only on `main` (`install.sh`, four test files) vanished from disk.
**The dangerous part was not the checkout, it was the read after it.** Reading `release.yml` to plan the next change showed `actions/checkout@v4` and `go-version: '1.26'` — the pre-bump content — for changes that had been committed and pushed hours earlier. The obvious next move is to "re-apply" them, which would have produced a duplicate or conflicting edit on top of work that was already correct.
**Where:** the repo's main working tree; all work was safe on `main` (`d5c04dd`) and `origin/main` throughout
**Fix:** `git switch main`, which correctly refused at first to avoid clobbering a modified `.serena/project.yml`. That file's working content turned out to be byte-identical to `main`'s committed version (same blob hashes, `0fb3888..1b4373f`) and only looked modified relative to the older tag; it was backed up before touching it and diffed afterwards to prove nothing was lost. Restoration verified three ways: `git diff origin/main` empty, every main-only file present, untracked paths still on disk.
**Preventative rule:** When a file's content contradicts a change you know you committed, check `git log -1` / `git branch --show-current` **before** re-applying anything — the likeliest explanation is that you are reading a different revision, not that the change was lost. And after any operation involving other revisions (worktree, bisect, checkout, a tool that may move refs), assert the tree is where you left it rather than assuming: a detached HEAD is invisible in ordinary file reads and makes correct work look undone.

## 2026-08-21 — Pinning the installer action is not pinning the tool it installs

**Category:** verification-gap
**Root cause:** `scripts/cosign-sign-blob.sh` passes `--use-signing-config`, a flag cosign gained in v3.1.0. `release.yml` pinned the *action* (`sigstore/cosign-installer@v3`) but not the *tool*, and that action's own default is v3.0.6 — which has no such flag. The script was written and tested against a locally installed v3.1.3, so it passed everywhere its author could run it and failed in the only environment that mattered. Releasing v1.0.4 died with `unknown flag: --use-signing-config` after GoReleaser had already built and archived all four binaries, burning a third version number.
**Where:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` (cosign install step); `scripts/cosign-sign-blob.sh`
**Fix:** pin `cosign-release: 'v3.1.3'`; add a preflight to the script that checks for the flag and fails naming the installed version and the required minimum, because without the flag cosign v3.1+ signs via a TUF-provided signing config instead of the static key — continuing would silently change the signature's provenance rather than break loudly; and a test asserting any workflow using `cosign-installer` pins its version. Verified end to end with a throwaway key: the script produces a bare base64 signature `cosign verify-blob` accepts, a tampered payload is rejected, and the preflight exits 1 against a stub mimicking v3.0.6 without writing a signature.
**Follow-on, v1.0.5 (same area, new cause):** the pin itself then broke the installer. `cosign-installer@v3` verifies a *custom* version by fetching a detached `cosign-linux-amd64.sig`, and **no cosign v3.x release publishes one** — including v3.0.6, its own default. The default path skips that fetch, so the unpinned action worked and any pin failed with curl exit 22. Fixing it required `cosign-installer@v4`, which verifies v3.0.1+ via `.sigstore.json` bundles (v3.1.3 publishes both the plain and `-kms` bundles, checked before switching). And `@v4` itself does not exist: this action publishes a moving `v3` tag but no `v4` (`refs/tags/v4` is 404 while `v4.1.2` resolves), so `@v4` would have failed to resolve exactly like the README's old `setup-pokkum@v1` — nearly shipping, in a workflow, the same bug a guard was written for in Markdown. Pinned to `v4.1.2`, and every action ref in every workflow was then checked to resolve.

**Preventative rule:** Pinning an installer action pins the *installer*, not the *thing installed* — a tool's version is a separate axis, and its default belongs to the action's maintainers, who can change it in a patch release. Whenever a repo script depends on a specific tool feature, pin the tool explicitly and have the script assert the feature exists rather than letting the underlying CLI's own error surface from the middle of a pipeline. **Check that a pin is even supported before adding one** — an installer's verification path can differ between its default and a custom version, so pinning is itself a change of code path, not merely of value. **And never assume a moving major tag exists**: verify the exact ref resolves (`gh api repos/<o>/<r>/git/ref/tags/<ref>`), because whether one is published is a per-project convention. **And when a step can only run in one environment, dry-run it before trusting it**: running the whole GoReleaser pipeline plus the npm build against a local clone took under a minute and immediately surfaced a further release-blocking bug (npm refuses a prerelease version without `--tag`) that would otherwise have cost a fourth version number. See `mem:self_review_checklist` row 48.

## 2026-08-21 — SLSA provenance attested binaries that were never released

**Category:** boundary / supply-chain
**Root cause:** `slsa-builder.yml` ran on every `v*` tag, *independently of* `release.yml`, and compiled its own copy of the binaries to attest. Those were not the artifacts anyone downloads: it produced raw `pokkum-linux-amd64` files stamped `-X main.version=$(git describe --tags)` → `v1.0.1`, while GoReleaser publishes `pokkum_1.0.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz` stamped `{{ .Version }}` → `1.0.1`. Different names, different packaging, different bytes. The provenance was real, signed, and about a parallel build that existed only inside that workflow. Worse, its subject was `sha256sum checksums.txt | base64`, making the single attested subject its own `checksums.txt` — a file that workflow never published — so the chain dead-ended before reaching any artifact at all.
**Second, louder symptom:** because it ran on tag push regardless of whether the release succeeded, every failed release still produced a GitHub Release containing nothing but `checksums.txt.intoto.jsonl`. That release became "Latest", and `install.sh` resolves `/releases/latest` — so a failed release silently broke the documented install path. This happened for v1.0.2, v1.0.3, v1.0.4 and v1.0.5 before the pattern was noticed; each time the fix looked like "delete the empty release" rather than "stop creating it".
**Where:** `.github/workflows/slsa-builder.yml` (deleted); provenance now in `.github/workflows/release.yml`'s `provenance` job
**Fix:** the provenance job now runs after GoReleaser in the same workflow and takes its subjects from `dist/checksums.txt` — GoReleaser's own checksum listing, already in `sha256sum` format, covering exactly the archives it published. Verified against the generic generator's documented contract (`sha256sum artifact1 artifact2 … | base64 -w0`). Gated on `always() && needs.release.outputs.hashes != ''`, so the binaries still get provenance if a later step (the npm publish) fails, while a release that never produced artifacts creates nothing at all. The duplicate build — and its drifting ldflags — is gone, along with the `check-build-flags.sh` rows and doc claims that described a third build path.
**Preventative rule:** An attestation, checksum, SBOM or signature must be derived from **the artifact that ships**, never from a re-derivation of it. A second build that "should" produce the same bytes is a claim requiring proof, and it drifts silently: nothing fails when it diverges, because both halves succeed — the attestation just quietly stops describing the download. Trace the artifact identity end to end (filename, packaging, embedded metadata), and if a verification workflow builds its own copy, that is the bug. Corollary: a workflow that publishes to a shared, user-visible surface (a GitHub Release, a tap, a registry) must not run independently of the workflow whose success it represents — make it depend on that success, or it will publish on behalf of failures. See `mem:self_review_checklist` row 49.

## 2026-08-21 — A parallel wave of six fixes, and four checks that could never fail

**Category:** verification-gap
**Root cause:** Five agents fixing separate field-report findings each turned up the same underlying shape — a control that looks like it works, reports success, and cannot report anything else. Recorded together because the pattern, not any single instance, is the lesson.

1. **`repro doctor`'s git check was a constant.** `gitClean` was initialised `true` and the only assignment inside the `.git` stat set it `true` again; no git command ran. It reported "no dirty modifications" for every tree, fed `allDeterministic`, and a field report cited it as *corroborating* the OCI label's claim that a tree was clean. A check that agrees with everything cannot corroborate anything. Found by an agent investigating something else, in a file I had edited hours earlier without noticing — while fixing that same command's *other* false-success bug.
2. **`ParseBunLock` could not parse a real lockfile.** `bun install` writes JSONC with a trailing comma; Go's `encoding/json` rejects it; every caller swallowed the error behind `if pErr == nil`. The parser returned zero packages for every real lockfile including this repo's own fixture, and a parser that silently resolves nothing is indistinguishable from a project with no dependencies. This is row 26's shape ("scan step errored" vs "found nothing") in a new place.
3. **A secret-guard rule that could never match.** `\bghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}\b` — exactly 36 characters with word boundaries — cannot match a real 38-character GitHub token, because `\b` fails when more alphanumerics follow. The rule existed, read correctly, and had never fired. The field report recorded GitHub PATs as "missed", attributing it to name-based detection; the real cause was an inert rule.
4. **My own new test targeted the wrong layer.** The first guard for #1 exercised `slsa.WorkingTreeDirty` directly and passed with the caller's fix reverted, because the helper was never broken — the defect was that `runReproDoctor` never called one. The shipped test drives the command and reads its JSON output.
**Where:** `cmd/pokkum/repro_doctor.go`, `internal/adapters/scannerutils/scannerutils.go`, `internal/adapters/secretguard/guard.go`
**Fix:** each above, with fail-first proofs; `slsa.WorkingTreeDirty` exported so `repro doctor` and provenance reach one verdict rather than a third implementation.
**Preventative rule:** For any check, rule or parser, ask what it does when it is working correctly and finds nothing, and whether that is distinguishable from it not running at all. Test a pattern against a **real specimen** — a genuine token, a genuine lockfile — not a synthetic one built to your own mental model of the format, because both the pattern and the synthetic example encode the same assumption and will agree with each other while both are wrong. And when a control is cited as corroborating another signal, check that it is capable of disagreeing before crediting it. See `mem:self_review_checklist` rows 47 and 50.

## 2026-08-21 — Test fixtures containing realistic credentials blocked the push

**Category:** process
**Root cause:** The new secret-guard rules needed specimens, so the tests carried literal Slack and Stripe token shapes. GitHub's push protection rejected the push, naming both. The values were synthetic, but a public supply-chain-security repository containing what read as live credentials is exactly what that scanner exists to prevent, and it cannot know a value in a test is fake. I had reviewed and approved those fixtures without considering where they would end up.
**Where:** `internal/adapters/secretguard/credential_formats_test.go`
**Fix:** the two blocked shapes are assembled at runtime (`"xoxb-" + "111111111111-" + …`), so the literal never appears at rest while the rule under test sees the identical string. Coverage unchanged; only the bytes in the repository differ. Push protection scans every commit in a push, so the already-made commit had to be replayed rather than fixed on top — captured from the reflog and re-committed with identical messages and file groupings, the only difference being the fixtures.
**Preventative rule:** A test that needs a credential-shaped specimen should assemble it at runtime rather than embed it. This is not only about scanners: a literal that looks live invites a reader to treat it as a leak, and a repository is the one place such a value can do real damage. Corollary for history: a secret in an unpushed commit must be removed from that commit, never merely deleted in a later one.
