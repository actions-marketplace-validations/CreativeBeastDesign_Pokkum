# Pokkum CLI Vocabulary

A single reference for every flag Pokkum's CLI exposes, the conventions flags follow, and the open backlog items on [docs/Roadmap.md](docs/Roadmap.md). See [docs/archive/fixes-to-v1.md](docs/archive/fixes-to-v1.md) and [docs/archive/for-users.md](docs/archive/for-users.md) for a post-v1.0 audit round that changed some of the behavior documented below.

Pokkum's stated model is "`ko` for SvelteKit" (see [README.md](README.md)), so the vocabulary borrows `ko`'s shape deliberately: a `*_DOCKER_REPO` environment variable as the one required input, `-f`/`--recursive` for manifest commands, `--local`/`--push`-style output-mode flags, `--platform` as the multi-arch surface, and boolean toggles that read as prose (`--bare`, `--insecure-registry` in `ko`; `--hardened`, `--dry-run` here). Where this document says "follows `ko` convention," that is the specific precedent being matched.

---

## 1. Conventions

These are the load-bearing patterns established across `cmd/pokkum/`:

1. **`POKKUM_` prefix for every environment variable**, mirroring `ko`'s `KO_` prefix (`KO_DOCKER_REPO` → `POKKUM_DOCKER_REPO`). Unlike `ko`, there is **no** generic dotted-key → `POKKUM_*` binding: `internal/adapters/config` used to construct a `viper.Viper` for exactly that, but it was dead code (`Load()` always parsed `.pokkum.yaml` directly via `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`, never through Viper) and was removed. Each environment override is instead a plain, explicit `os.Getenv("POKKUM_...")` call at its own use site in `cmd/pokkum/build.go`, covering only this fixed set of `.pokkum.yaml` fields: `docker.repo` (`POKKUM_DOCKER_REPO`), `docker.tags` (`POKKUM_DOCKER_TAGS`, comma-splitting like `--tag`), `security.fail_on_cve` (`POKKUM_FAIL_ON_CVE`), a profile's `sourcemap` (`POKKUM_SOURCEMAP`), `stub_launcher` (`POKKUM_STUB_LAUNCHER`), `cache.verify_mode` (`POKKUM_CACHE_VERIFY_MODE`), `cache.pubkey` (`POKKUM_CACHE_PUBKEY`), `cache.keyless_identity` (`POKKUM_CACHE_KEYLESS_IDENTITY`), and `cache.keyless_issuer` (`POKKUM_CACHE_KEYLESS_ISSUER`). Every other field — `strategy`, `base`, `platforms`, all of `image.*`, `security.verify_base`/`allow_incomplete_scans`/`allow_secret_patterns`, `sbom.*`, `cache.enabled`, `otel.*`, and `docker.repo`/`docker.tags`/`security.fail_on_cve`/etc. *within a named profile* — is config-file/flag only, with no environment override. A new field does **not** imply a new env var for free; adding one means adding an explicit `os.Getenv` call at the field's read site in `build.go` and documenting it here. See `internal/adapters/config` and the canonical example at `testdata/config/pokkum.yaml.golden`.
   - Four further `POKKUM_*` env vars exist with **no** corresponding `.pokkum.yaml` field at all, by design — key material and public-key trust anchors are never persisted to a project config file that might get committed: `POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY` (private signing key: PEM text or a file path; see §3's `--signing-key`), `POKKUM_SIGNING_PUBKEY` (public key for verifying Pokkum's own signed images — read by `pokkum verify` and by remote-cache-hit verification, both as one step in a longer fallback chain — see §13 and §3's `--cache-verify-key` note), and `POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY` (public key for static-key base-image verification, `internal/adapters/baseimage`). Remote-cache-hit verification adds one further, *derived* link after all three: the public half of `POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY`/`--signing-key`, consulted only when every explicit source above is empty (see §3's `--cache-verify-key`). **As of 2026-08-18 (commit `a149b28`, Roadmap 2h) there is no fallback beyond these:** the shared hardcoded placeholder public key these three used to fall back to when unset (`cosign.DefaultPublicKeyPEM`, byte-identical to `baseimage.DefaultBaseImagePublicKeyPEM`) has been deleted — a trust anchor nobody owns is worse than no default. Static-key verification with none of the relevant chain set now fails closed with an explicit "no key is configured" error naming the exact env var/flag to set, distinct from "signature checked and found invalid." **Breaking change** for anyone who had static-key verification enabled with no key configured — it used to run (harmlessly, since the placeholder could never match) and now refuses outright; see `docs/archive/for-users.md`.
2. **Precedence: flag > environment variable > profile > config file > default**, threaded through `cmd/pokkum/build.go` per-field (see item 1 above for exactly which fields have an environment step) and, for profiles, resolved by `config.Manager.ApplyProfile` before flags/env are layered on top. Document this precedence for every setting readable from more than one source.
3. **Boolean toggles ship in on/off pairs, not a single bidirectional flag.** `--telemetry` / `--no-telemetry`, `--security-context` / `--no-security-context`. The negative flag always wins when both are set (`securityContextEnabled`, `k8s.go:26`) — this is the tie-break rule, not an error, so keep using it rather than rejecting the combination.
4. **Shorthand letters are reserved for flags used on (almost) every invocation**: `-p` for `--platform` (`build`), `-f` for `--file` (`resolve`/`apply`/`rollback`), matching `ko build -p` / `ko resolve -f`. Do not hand out a shorthand to a flag used occasionally.
5. **A convenience flag that's shorthand for a more general one is named after the concrete case, not the mechanism**: `--hardened` is sugar for `--base chainguard`, not `--base-preset=hardened`. Prefer this over adding more enum values to an existing flag when the shortcut deserves top-billing.
6. **Mutually exclusive flags are rejected explicitly and early**, before any network or filesystem work (`--local` + `--tarball` + `--to-oci-layout`, `--dry-run` + `--print-manifest`). A new pair of mutually exclusive flags should fail with a `fmt.Errorf("cannot specify both --x and --y")`-shaped message before `req.Normalize()`.
7. **Output-mode flags are exclusive and default to "push"**: no flag set means push to `POKKUM_DOCKER_REPO`, exactly like plain `ko build`. `--local`, `--tarball` and `--to-oci-layout` are the escape hatches, following `ko`'s `--local`/`--push=false` distinction.
8. **`--output=json` is the one CI-consumption flag**, reserved for *results* (a stable, versioned schema), never for retargeting where logs go — logs always go to stderr, structured or not, controlled separately by `--log-format`.
9. **Global logging flags (`--log-level`, `--log-format`) are registered twice on purpose**: once as `rootCmd.PersistentFlags()` for subcommands that don't redeclare them, and once again on `build` itself, because `main.go` pre-parses `os.Args` by hand (the `flag()` helper) to configure `slog` *before* cobra has even constructed the command tree.
10. **`pokkum resolve` / `pokkum apply` intentionally expose no per-project build flags** other than cluster-facing options — every `pokkum://` reference is built with `Normalize()`'s defaults (multi-platform, distroless, SPDX-JSON SBOM). New build-time flags belong on `pokkum build`; only cluster-facing toggles belong on `resolve`/`apply`.

11. **Compiler build optimization flags are enforced in every release build path, not exposed as CLI flags** (Roadmap "Compiler Build Optimization Flags"): every `pokkum` binary is compiled with `-trimpath` and `-ldflags="-s -w"` (strip DWARF/symbol tables) for a significant size reduction, in two places — the `Makefile` `build`/`supervisor` targets and `.goreleaser.yaml` (the official `pokkum upgrade` release pipeline). Both also set `-X main.version/commit/buildDate` so `pokkum version` reports real release metadata. `scripts/check-build-flags.sh`, wired into `make verify` as its Step 0, fails the build if either path drops `-trimpath`, `-s -w`, or the `-X main.version` ldflag — guarding the size optimization against silent regression.
12. **Test/coverage/fuzz infrastructure lives in `Makefile` targets, not `pokkum` CLI flags** (added alongside the CI hardening pass that installed Bun so the real-build e2e tests stop silently skipping): `make test-race` runs the race detector scoped to the packages where concurrency actually lives (`internal/adapters/registry`, `internal/core`, `internal/adapters/packager`, `supervisor`) rather than the full `./...` tree; `make coverage` generates `coverage.out` across the whole module; `make check-coverage` enforces the floor `scripts/check-coverage.sh` reads from that profile (a ratchet off the measured baseline — 73.0% at the time it was added, against a measured 75.5%, not an aspirational target); `make fuzz-smoke` runs every `FuzzXxx` target briefly (30s each) via `scripts/run-fuzz.sh`, which discovers targets dynamically rather than hardcoding a list — the same script backs the nightly `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` job. `make check-embedded-blobs` (added 2026-08-19) rebuilds the embedded `pokkum-init`/`pokkum-static` PID-1 binaries fresh from source with the exact `Makefile` build flags and compares them byte-for-byte against what's actually `go:embed`-ded, run with `-count=1` because `go test`'s result cache cannot see through an exec'd `go build` into another package's source; wired into `make verify` as an explicit extra step beyond the canonical five (it guards a local working-tree hazard — a stale local blob a developer forgot to rebuild — that's structurally impossible in CI, which always rebuilds both blobs from the checked-out commit first, so it isn't part of the PR-gate job). None of the five `make verify` steps in `mem:task_completion` currently include `test-race`/`coverage`/`fuzz-smoke` — they are separate, additional gates, run in CI as their own scoped jobs. Two further env vars belong to this same test-only category and are deliberately **not** rows in §1's `POKKUM_*` table or §18/18b's runtime tables below, despite sharing the `POKKUM_` prefix: `POKKUM_REQUIRE_RUNTIME_SMOKE` (read by `tests/integration/*_test.go`) and `POKKUM_REQUIRE_MINIFIED_CORPUS` (read by `internal/adapters/secretguard/minified_corpus_test.go`) turn a `t.Skip` into a `t.Fatal` when a precondition their respective test suite depends on (a built runtime smoke fixture, a real minified-build-output corpus) is absent — CI sets both so a missing fixture fails loudly there instead of silently reporting a passing suite that skipped everything. Neither is read by any `pokkum` binary, `.pokkum.yaml` field, or built image; they configure `go test`'s own behavior, exactly like `test-race`/`coverage`/`fuzz-smoke` above, so they're documented here rather than implied to be part of the CLI's environment-variable surface.

## 2. Global Flags (Root Command, Persistent)

| Flag | Env / Config | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--log-level` | — | `INFO` | Log level: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`. |
| `--log-format` | — | `auto` | Log format. `auto` renders a human-readable console view (level glyph, bold message, attributes inline when short or as an aligned indented block when long) **only when stderr is an interactive terminal**, and byte-identical `text` logfmt otherwise — so piped and CI output is unchanged. `console` forces the human view even when piped (e.g. `2>&1 | less -R`); `text` forces logfmt even on a terminal, which is what scripts parsing the output should pin; `json` is unchanged. Colour additionally honours `NO_COLOR` and `TERM=dumb`, both of which keep the layout and drop the escape sequences. |
| `--output` | — | `text` | Output serialization format: `text` or `json`. |

---

## 3. `pokkum build [dir]`

| Flag | Shorthand | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--profile` | `-P` | — | (none) | Activate a named build profile defined in `.pokkum.yaml` (e.g. `--profile local`, `--profile production`). Applies profile overrides with precedence: CLI flag > Env var > Profile > Top-level config > Defaults. |
| `--platform` | `-p` | — | `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` | Target platform(s); repeatable. `all` selects every supported platform. |
| `--tag` | `-t` | `POKKUM_DOCKER_TAGS` | `latest` | Image tag(s) to apply, without the repository prefix; repeatable or comma-separated (e.g. `--tag v1.2.3 --tag latest`). Precedence: flag > `POKKUM_DOCKER_TAGS` > `docker.tags` (base or active profile) > `latest`. Applied registry-side after the image is built and hashed, so the tag set never affects the image digest. Validated via `go-containerregistry`'s `name.NewTag`; duplicates are rejected. |
| `--base` | — | `base` | (unset → `distroless`) | A base image preset — `distroless`, `chainguard`, `distroless-node`, `custom` — **or** a full image reference (`registry/repo:tag`, `repo@sha256:…`), which maps to the `custom` preset. Presets are tried first; only a reference-shaped value (containing `/`, `.`, `:` or `@`) is parsed as a reference, so a mistyped preset is rejected with the list of valid ones rather than silently becoming a Docker Hub shorthand lookup that fails much later at pull time. **A custom reference defaults to static-key verification**, which fails closed since the placeholder trust anchor was removed — so you must set `POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY` to the Cosign public key that signed it, or pass `--no-verify-base`. The error names the variable. Each custom reference gets its **own** `pokkum.lock` slot (`custom:<first-12-hex-of-sha256(ref)>`), so two custom bases in one project each keep a stable pin instead of evicting each other. A locked entry is still only reused when its recorded ref matches (and, for scan metadata and mirror carry-over, its digest too). A lockfile written by an older Pokkum keeps its pin under the bare `custom` key; that entry is honoured once — only if its recorded ref matches what you are building — then rewritten under the per-reference key and removed, so upgrading does not silently re-pull. A bare `custom` entry belonging to a *different* reference is neither trusted nor deleted. |
| `--hardened` | — | — | `false` | Shorthand for `--base chainguard`. |
| `--sbom` | — | — | `spdx-json` | SBOM format: `spdx-json`, `cyclonedx-json`, or `none`. The document catalogues **both** the resolved base image's OS packages (Debian/Ubuntu `pkg:deb/<distro>/<name>@<ver>?arch=…` or Alpine/Wolfi/Chainguard `pkg:apk/…` purls, read from its dpkg/apk database) and the project's own npm dependency graph as `pkg:npm/…`, the latter scoped to **production** dependencies — computed by a real reachability walk over `bun.lock` (root → `dependencies`/`optionalDependencies`/`peerDependencies` edges), matching what `bun install --production` actually stages, not a blanket "drop devDependencies" heuristic. Excluded dev-only packages are recorded via SPDX annotations / CycloneDX properties (`pokkum:` prefix, alongside the existing `pokkum:osPackagesScanned` marker) rather than silently dropped, and "no OS packages found" vs. "OS packages never checked" are always distinguishable in the same way. |
| `--sbom-attach` | — | — | `auto` | SBOM attachment mode: `auto` (tries OCI 1.1 Referrers first, falls back to the legacy `.sbom` tag on registries that don't support referrers — ECR, older Harbor, older Artifactory), `referrer` (OCI 1.1, fails loudly if unsupported rather than falling back), or `tag` (always the legacy `.sbom` tag). **Whenever this build actually signs** (a signing key is configured; see `--signing-key`), the SBOM is *also* wrapped in an in-toto Statement naming the pushed image digest as its subject, DSSE-signed with the build's key, and attached as a second layer of the same `.att` attestation used for SLSA provenance — `predicateType` `https://spdx.dev/Document` (SPDX) or `https://cyclonedx.org/bom` (CycloneDX), resolvable with `cosign verify-attestation --type spdxjson` independently of Pokkum. This closes a real gap: the legacy `.sbom` tag this flag otherwise controls is a bare, unauthenticated blob — before the attestation existed, it could be swapped for a different SBOM on a signed, self-verified image without any verification path noticing. The legacy tag/referrer form is still published for compatibility either way; prefer the attestation when a consumer can read it. Without a configured signing key, only the legacy tag/referrer attachment happens, same as before. |
| `--local` | — | — | `false` | Load into the local Docker daemon instead of pushing. Mutually exclusive with `--tarball` and `--to-oci-layout`. Daemon load drops OCI annotations; a warning names exactly which keys are lost. |
| `--image-label` | — | — | (none) | Custom image label (`key=value`), repeatable. `org.opencontainers.image.revision`/`.source`/`.version`/`.created` are auto-populated by default even without this flag; an explicit `--image-label org.opencontainers.image.<key>=...` always overrides the auto-populated value. `revision`/`source`/`version` come from git (commit SHA, remote URL, `git describe`) or CI env vars — no opt-out flag exists, and outside a git repo they're silently absent (no warning). `created` is set to the same resolved `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` timestamp used everywhere else in the build (never independently resolved, so it can't disagree with the image's real layer timestamps), and is left unset rather than fabricated when that timestamp is undetermined. |
| `--base-verify-mode` | — | — | `auto` | Base image verification mode: `auto` (keyless for stock presets, static-key for custom), `keyless`, or `static-key`. **`static-key` (including `auto`'s default for a `custom` base preset) requires `POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY` to be set — there is no fallback key.** Without it, resolution fails closed with an explicit "no key is configured" error rather than attempting verification against anything (breaking change, 2026-08-18, commit `a149b28`; see `docs/archive/for-users.md`). |
| `--base-keyless-identity` | — | — | (preset default) | Override the expected Fulcio certificate SAN for keyless verification. Setting only this (without `--base-keyless-issuer`) makes the identity non-empty, so the preset's own default is *not* merged in for the missing half — verification then fails with a "must specify Issuer criteria" error rather than falling back. Set both together, or neither. |
| `--base-keyless-issuer` | — | — | (preset default) | Override the expected OIDC issuer for keyless verification. Same partial-override caveat as `--base-keyless-identity` above, in reverse. |
| `--no-container` | — | — | `false` | (`pokkum dev`) Skip image construction entirely and run the project's own dev server (`bun run dev`) directly on the host, for fast local iteration. **This mode has none of the runtime guarantees a real Pokkum image provides** — no supervisor, no startup attestation, no probes, no base image, no non-root user — and it does not reproduce production; a warning says so at startup. Use the default container-parity mode when a real environment check matters. Rejected in combination with `--debug`, `--platform`, `--bun-version` and `--bun-variant`, which all describe an image that is never built; warns on `--port` (the dev server chooses its own) and `--watch` (hot reload is inherent to the dev server). `--bun-binary` and `--env-file` remain meaningful. |
| `--sigstore-tuf-refresh` | — | — | `false` | Opt in to refreshing the Sigstore trust root from the live TUF repository before verifying, instead of using the snapshot embedded in the binary. Off by default: verification is fully offline unless you ask otherwise. **Bound to `--hermetic`** on `pokkum build` — a hermetic build refuses to fetch before a TUF client is even constructed, so the embedded snapshot is used and no network is touched. A refresh failure is never fatal: it warns and falls back to the embedded root. An explicit `--sigstore-trusted-root=<file>` always wins over this flag. The trust anchor actually used is logged (`origin=embedded snapshot` or `origin=TUF repository`) so it is on the record rather than implicit. |
| `--sigstore-trusted-root` | — | — | (embedded) | Path to a custom Sigstore trusted root snapshot (e.g. for a private Sigstore deployment). The file is read once, up front, by the CLI and the same bytes feed every consumer (base-image verification and remote-cache verification), so the two can never end up checking against different roots. **An unreadable path fails the build closed** rather than silently falling back to the embedded root — verifying against a root you did not ask for is exactly the substitution the flag exists to prevent. |
| `--no-verify-base` | — | — | `false` | Suppress base image signature verification entirely (both static-key and keyless). |
| `--allow-secret-pattern` | — | — | (none) | Regex pattern to ignore during build-time secret scanning, repeatable. |
| `--exclude-route` | `build.exclude_routes` | — | (none) | Keep a route out of the image, repeatable (`--exclude-route=/dev`). Patterns are route paths, not file globs: a bare path covers the route **and its subtree** (`/admin` excludes `/admin/users` but not `/administration` — matching stops at a segment boundary), `*` matches within one segment and `**` across segments. Route groups are transparent, so `/pricing` matches a route living at `(marketing)/pricing`. Flag values and config values are merged, not overridden. **Two mechanisms, and the log says which one you got.** Where Pokkum authors the project's Vite config, it stages a symlink mirror of the routes directory without the excluded routes and points `kit.files.routes` at it — the route is never a bundle entry point, so its code, its imports and its SBOM entries are absent from the image entirely. Where it cannot (a build script that does more than `vite build`, a bare `sveltekit()` whose options live in `svelte.config.js`, or SvelteKit older than 2.62.0, which cannot take config inline), it falls back to deleting the route's prerendered output — the page is gone, its chunks are not — and warns saying so. Refused outright when the project sets `resolve.preserveSymlinks: true`, which would break every relative import that escapes the routes directory. A pattern matching nothing warns; so does a surviving page still linking to an excluded route, since that link now 404s. |
| `--show-secret-values` | — | — | `false` | Reveal the matched text of each secret-guard finding instead of redacting it. Intended for local triage: a false positive in minified output cannot be judged from file/line/column alone without reading bytes out of a single-line chunk by hand. **Never set this in CI** — for a genuine finding the matched text is the credential, and it would land in the build log. Findings always report `file`, `line`, `col` and `rule` regardless. |
| *(inline)* | — | — | — | A source comment containing `pokkum:allow-secret`, on the flagged line or the one directly above it, exempts that single line. Matched as a substring, so `//`, `#`, `/* */` and `<!-- -->` all work. Preferred over a regex for a genuine one-off, because a pattern matches a whole line and therefore has to describe the content — which, for a real secret, means committing it to config. Cannot be used for generated or minified output, which has no comments: use `--allow-secret-pattern` / `security.allow_secret_patterns` there. |
| `--require-env` | — | — | (none) | Declare required runtime environment variables (comma-separated or repeatable). Stamped into image annotations (`pokkum.dev/required-env`) and validated by the supervisor on container boot. |
| `--origin` | — | — | (none) | Canonical origin (e.g. `https://example.com`) written to `ORIGIN` — see §18b. Recommended for any deployment behind a reverse proxy/ingress. |
| `--protocol-header` | — | — | (none) | Proxy header adapter-node trusts for the request protocol, written to `PROTOCOL_HEADER` — see §18b. |
| `--host-header` | — | — | (none) | Proxy header adapter-node trusts for the request host, written to `HOST_HEADER` — see §18b. |
| `--address-header` | — | — | (none) | Proxy header adapter-node trusts for the client IP, written to `ADDRESS_HEADER` — see §18b. |
| `--xff-depth` | — | — | `0` (adapter-node's own default of `1` applies) | Trusted proxy hop count for `--address-header`, written to `XFF_DEPTH` — see §18b. |
| `--body-size-limit` | — | — | (none, adapter-node's own default of `512K` applies) | Request body size cap in adapter-node's size-string format, written to `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT` — see §18b. |
| `--fail-on-cve` | — | `POKKUM_FAIL_ON_CVE` | (none) | Fail build if base image vulnerabilities exceed threshold (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`; default warn-only). |
| `--allow-incomplete` | — | — | `false` | Allow build to succeed even if base image vulnerability database lookups fail (default: fail closed when `--fail-on-cve` is active). |
| `--allow-server-code-in-static` | — | `build.allow_server_code_in_static` | `false` | Proceed with `--strategy=static` even when the project contains code SvelteKit cannot prerender. See **Static-build preflight** below — this is an escape hatch for a false positive in that check, not a normal setting. |
| `--vex-output` | — | — | (none) | Write a real OpenVEX v0.2.0 JSON document (one `not_affected` statement per active `.pokkum.yaml` `security.vex_exemptions` entry) to the given path after a successful build. No file is written if there are no exemptions. |
| `--hermetic` | — | — | `false` | Enforce strict hermetic build mode: on Linux, real kernel-enforced network isolation (an unprivileged network namespace) around both build subprocess stages, no IP network egress possible regardless of what a build script does. Also strips `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`/`SSH_AGENT_PID`/`GPG_AGENT_INFO`/`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`/`DOCKER_HOST` from the subprocess's environment — closes SSH-agent-forwarding fully. A *pathname* Unix domain socket reachable by hardcoded/conventional path (e.g. a bind-mounted `/var/run/docker.sock`) needs the separate opt-in `--hermetic-mount-isolation` flag below to close, since network isolation alone does nothing for it. On non-Linux, advisory-only (`BUN_OFFLINE=1` and friends, clearly logged as such). Also requires cached base images and pre-populated `node_modules`, and fails closed (rather than downloading) on a cold Bun-runtime cache. |
| `--hermetic-mount-isolation` | — | — | `false` | With `--hermetic` on Linux, additionally block path-based Unix domain socket access (starting with `/var/run/docker.sock`/`/run/docker.sock`, if either exists) for the build subprocess, via a `/proc/self/exe` reexec into a fresh `CLONE_NEWNS` mount namespace with those specific paths bind-masked. **Opt-in, default off** — new, previously-unexercised raw-syscall code, deliberately not folded into `--hermetic`'s own default behavior. Ignored (with a warning) without `--hermetic` or on non-Linux hosts. Known, documented residual limitation: the sandboxed build process retains the same namespace-level capability used to create the mask, so a sufficiently sophisticated dependency that specifically knows this mechanism exists could in principle undo it — see `docs/Roadmap.md`. |
| `--registry-config` | — | — | (none) | Path to a `docker config.json`-style auth file, keyed by registry hostname (`"auths": {"<host>": {...}}`), with dynamic credential-helper execution (`credHelpers`, `credsStore`) shelling out to `docker-credential-*` binaries (e.g. ECR, GCR, OSXKeychain) and caching credentials in-memory, merged ahead of `authn.DefaultKeychain`. |
| `--push-concurrency` | — | — | `0` (→ `4`) | Number of concurrent layer uploads during registry push. `0` defers to the registry adapter's built-in default (currently 4 parallel jobs via `remoteConfig.Jobs`); set a positive integer to override. Also raises the pull-limiter used by the same push's manifest `Head`/`Tag` reconciliation calls, since they share the same `remote.Option` set — a minor harmless side effect worth knowing about, not a separate tunable. |
| `--asset-overlay` | — | — | `0` | Rolling-deploy asset overlay: resolves the last N generations previously pushed to the same `repo:tag` (via each generation's own `pokkum.dev/predecessor` manifest annotation, walked backward — not `pokkum.dev/image-history`, which `build` cannot read), pulls each one's `/app/client` immutable (`_app/immutable/`) content by digest, and merges non-conflicting files into a new, separate OCI layer so a browser holding a prior generation's HTML mid-rollout can still fetch its old hashed chunk instead of 404ing. Same hashed path with different bytes across generations is a hard build failure, never a silent pick. `0` (default) is off, preserving current behavior. Auto-discovery only works when pushing to a registry (no "current tag" exists for `--local`/`--tarball`/`--to-oci-layout`); combine with `--asset-overlay-from` for other output modes. The predecessor annotation is stamped only on pushes that actually use this flag, so a later build's auto-discovery can only find a chain that itself opted in from the start. **Known gap:** `pokkum verify`'s default rebuild-and-compare path (i.e. without `--no-rebuild`) does not currently reproduce the overlay layer — verifying an asset-overlay image reports it as a mismatch; see §13 below. |
| `--asset-overlay-from` | — | — | (none) | Comma-separated explicit image refs (e.g. digests or tags) to use as `--asset-overlay`'s source generations instead of registry-side auto-discovery. Works regardless of `--output` mode, since refs name arbitrary external images rather than this build's own push target. Truncated to the first `--asset-overlay=<n>` refs if more are given. |
| `--tarball` | — | — | (none) | Export to the given path in the legacy **docker-save** format (not an OCI archive — the format has no annotations field at all). Mutually exclusive with `--local` and `--to-oci-layout`. Every OCI annotation is therefore dropped, and a multi-platform build is flattened into one platform-suffixed tag per architecture rather than a manifest list; a warning names the dropped keys. `docker load` accepts this format — use it when that is what you need, and `--to-oci-layout` when you need the metadata to survive. |
| `--to-oci-layout` | — | — | (none) | Export as a standards-conformant **OCI image layout** into the given directory (`oci-layout`, `index.json`, `blobs/sha256/…`). Mutually exclusive with `--local` and `--tarball`. Needs no Docker/Podman daemon and no registry, which is what makes it the mode a hermetic CI runner or a daemonless contributor machine can use. Unlike `--tarball` it is **lossless**: every OCI annotation survives (`org.opencontainers.image.*` and `pokkum.dev/*` alike, on both the per-platform manifests and the index), and a multi-platform build is written as a real manifest list instead of being flattened. `index.json` carries one descriptor per tag annotated with both `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name` (bare tag — what skopeo's `oci:` transport and podman match on) and `io.containerd.image.name` (fully qualified — what containerd's importer, and therefore `ctr images import`/`k3d image import`/`minikube image load`, reads first). Written to a staging directory and swapped into place, so an interrupted run leaves the previous layout or nothing, and a re-run replaces rather than merges. `docker load` does **not** accept this format — use `--tarball` for that. Signing/SBOM/attestation attachment still require push output. |
| `--dry-run` | — | — | `false` | Resolve and report; perform no writes. Mutually exclusive with `--print-manifest`. |
| `--no-deploy` | — | — | `false` | Skip the automatic post-push deploy configured under `deploy:` in `.pokkum.yaml` for this build. Never *enables* a deploy — a project with no `deploy.target` never deploys regardless. See §4b. |
| `--print-manifest` | — | — | `false` | Emit the computed OCI manifest/config without pushing. Mutually exclusive with `--dry-run`. |
| `--log-level` | — | — | `INFO` | Same as global flag; redeclared for early pre-parse. |
| `--log-format` | — | — | `auto` | Same as global flag; redeclared for early pre-parse. |
| `--telemetry` | — | — | `false` | Enable a real OpenTelemetry NodeSDK + OTLP trace exporter bootstrap, started before your app runs. Works for both `--strategy=exe` (compiled into the entrypoint) and `--strategy=layered`, the default (packaged as a `bun --preload`'d file) — see §3a. Does **not** auto-instrument HTTP/framework code, and does not export metrics — see §3a below for exactly what this does and doesn't do, and the required `hooks.server.ts` snippet to get any real spans at all. |
| `--no-telemetry` | — | — | `false` | Explicitly disable telemetry; wins over `--telemetry` if both are set. |
| `--otel-export` | — | — | (none) | Override the OTLP exporter endpoint URL. |
| `--telemetry-env` | — | — | (none) | Target environment for telemetry (`dev`, `preview`, `production`). |
| `--trace-sample-rate` | — | — | `1.0` | Trace span sampling ratio, `0.0`–`1.0`. |
| `--metrics-only` | — | — | `false` | ⚠️ **Currently non-functional** (see §3a) — combining an OTLP metrics exporter with the SDK crashes once compiled under Bun (a real Bun bundler bug, not a Pokkum bug). The compiled bootstrap detects this flag and logs a runtime warning rather than silently doing nothing or crashing. |
| `--with-otel-sidecar` | — | — | `false` | Inject an OTEL Collector sidecar spec into generated Kubernetes manifests. The sidecar container exposes `4317` (OTLP gRPC), `4318` (OTLP HTTP) and `8889` (Prometheus metrics scrape), and generated NetworkPolicy egress allows `4317`/`4318` always plus `8889` when this flag is set. **These ports belong to the `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` sidecar, not to Pokkum** — no Pokkum binary ever binds them. |
| `--sign` | — | — | `true` | Enable SLSA, Cosign, and DSSE signing. Real end-to-end as of 2026-08-18: signs, attaches (dual-published to the index and every per-platform manifest), then fetches the signature/attestation back from the registry and cryptographically re-verifies them before the build reports success. **Signing only actually happens with a key configured** (see `--signing-key` below) — without one, a signing-enabled build pushes UNSIGNED with a loud warning and records that in `BuildResult.Signing` rather than claiming to have signed. Static-key only; there is no keyless (Fulcio/OIDC) path for *signing* what Pokkum builds (keyless Sigstore is verification-only — base images, `pokkum verify`). |
| `--no-sign` | — | — | `false` | Explicitly disable signing; wins over `--sign` if both are set. |
| `--signing-key` | — | `POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY` | (none) | Private signing key (ECDSA P-256 or Ed25519): a path to a PEM file, or the PEM text itself. The public half is derived automatically and is what post-push self-verification checks against. Key material is never logged. Without this (and without `POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY`), `--sign`'s default behavior pushes unsigned with a warning. |
| `--require-signed` | — | — | `false` | Fail the build unless the pushed image is signed, attested, and self-verified against the registry — the CI gate that turns "warn on unsigned" into "refuse to succeed unsigned." Requires a signing key and a registry push — i.e. none of `--local`/`--tarball`/`--to-oci-layout` (validated at request time, before any build work runs). |
| `--inject` | — | — | `true` | Enable zero-config auto-injection: surgically injects/overrides the required SvelteKit adapter via a `.pokkum/vite.config.ts` wrapper and runs `bun x vite build --config .pokkum/vite.config.ts` without mutating user-authored files. Two preconditions, neither previously documented: the adapter **package** must be present (injection configures an adapter, it cannot install one), and `package.json`'s `build` script must be exactly `vite build` — injection replaces the build invocation with `bun x vite build --config .pokkum/vite.config.ts`, so it declines whenever that would skip anything else the script does (env setup, codegen, a task runner). When it declines, the error now says which precondition failed. |
| `--no-inject` | — | — | `false` | Disable auto-injection; fails fast with `core.ErrAdapterMisconfigured` if the project's own config lacks the required adapter. |
| `--update-base` | — | — | `false` | Force re-resolving base image tags against remote registry and update `pokkum.lock`. |
| `--offline` | — | — | `false` | Strictly enforce using `pokkum.lock` and local cache without remote registry calls. |
| `--bun-binary` | — | — | (none) | Local filesystem path escape hatch to a `bun` executable (skips resolution/download/stub-compilation). |
| `--bun-variant` | — | — | `standard` | Bun CPU variant (`standard` [AVX2 required on x86-64] or `baseline`). |
| `--runtime` | — | `runtime` | `bun` | Application runtime the built image executes under. `bun` embeds a checksum-pinned Bun binary as its own layer. `node` takes the runtime from the base image instead — it defaults the base to the `distroless-node` preset (`gcr.io/distroless/nodejs24-debian12:nonroot`, keyless-verified with the same Fulcio identity as `distroless`) and ships no Bun layer, so the Node version is whatever the pinned base digest carries and is refreshed with `pokkum base update`. `node` supports `--strategy=layered` only, and is rejected together with `--stub-launcher`, `--bun-binary`, an explicit `--bun-version`/`--bun-variant`, `--telemetry` (the layered bootstrap is Bun-specific), and the `distroless`/`chainguard` presets, which ship no Node. A custom `--base` is allowed but must provide `/nodejs/bin/node`. The runtime joins the composite remote-cache input hash, gets its own `pokkum.lock` slot via the preset, keys the toolchain CVE lookup, and is recorded in SLSA provenance as `externalParameters.runtime`. Images built with a non-default runtime also carry a `dev.pokkum.runtime` label; its absence means `bun`. |
| `--bun-version` | — | — | (none, resolves to the pinned default) | Bun release version to embed. A small set of common versions is checksum-verified against statically pinned SHA256 digests; any other version is verified against Bun's own GPG-signed `SHASUMS256.txt.asc` release manifest before use — never installed unverified. Also available on `pokkum dev`. |
| `--stub-launcher` | — | `POKKUM_STUB_LAUNCHER` | `false` | Compile a minimal entrypoint launcher stub instead of embedding stock Bun runtime (layered strategy runtime hardening). |
| `--strategy` | — | — | `layered` | Packaging strategy (`layered` [multi-layer layout — see `pokkum explain` for a given build's real breakdown], `static` [zero-JS static site], or `exe` [single executable, deprecated]). |
| `--static` | — | — | `false` | Shorthand for `--strategy=static`: compile a purely static site onto a minimal libc-free `chainguard/static` image served by the embedded `pokkum-static` PID-1 file server (no Bun runtime, no compiled executable). Conflicts with `--strategy=exe`; defaults the base to the static image when no `--base`/`--hardened` is given. |
| `--compression` | — | — | `gzip` | Layer compression algorithm (`gzip` or `zstd`). |
| `--sourcemap` | — | `POKKUM_SOURCEMAP` | `false` | Generate and preserve source maps in compiled bundles and vendor layers. |
| `--no-prune` | — | — | `false` | Disable build-time stripping of non-runtime files (`*.d.ts`, `*.map`, `tsconfig.json`, `README*`, tests) from `/app/vendor`. |
| `--keep-vendor` | — | — | (none) | Custom glob pattern(s) of vendor files to preserve during pruning, repeatable (e.g. `--keep-vendor='*.md'`). |
| `--no-precompress` | — | — | `false` | Disable build-time static asset pre-compression (`.gz`/`.br`; also `.zst` under `--strategy=static`) for `/app/client`. |
| `--no-strip` | — | — | `false` | Disable build-time stripping of unneeded debug symbols from native `.node` ELF addons. |
| `--no-cache` | — | — | `false` | Disable checking and publishing to the remote composite OCI input cache. |
| `--no-cache-verify` | — | — | `false` | Disable cryptographic signature verification on remote cache-hit images. |
| `--cache-verify-mode` | — | `POKKUM_CACHE_VERIFY_MODE` | `auto` | Cache image signature verification mode: `auto` (default), `static-key`, or `keyless`. |
| `--cache-verify-key` | — | `POKKUM_CACHE_PUBKEY` | (none) | Path or PEM string for static Cosign public key to verify remote cache hits. Fallback chain if unset: `POKKUM_CACHE_PUBKEY` → `POKKUM_SIGNING_PUBKEY` → `POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY` → the public half of this build's own `--signing-key`/`POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY`, **no fallback beyond that** (the shared placeholder key this chain used to fall back to is deleted as of 2026-08-18, commit `a149b28`). The last link is derived, not configured: a build signed with `--signing-key` alone can therefore verify and reuse the cache entries it signed itself, without a second key needing to be set. It is consulted strictly last, so an explicitly configured cache-verify key is never overridden by it, and it narrows rather than widens trust — the static-key check accepts a candidate only if the signature verifies against that one key, so "my own signing key" means "only entries I signed myself," where the alternative is no key at all and every candidate refused. When it engages, an `INFO` line names it explicitly rather than deriving trust silently. A static-key cache candidate found with none of these set (including no signing key) is treated as unverified — same fail-safe outcome as before (cache miss, fall through to a full rebuild, or a hard failure under `--cache-verify-strict`), now with an explicit "no key is configured" log/error instead of a silent mismatch against an unmatchable placeholder. |
| `--cache-keyless-identity` | — | `POKKUM_CACHE_KEYLESS_IDENTITY` | (none) | Expected Fulcio certificate Subject Alternative Name for keyless cache verification. |
| `--cache-keyless-issuer` | — | `POKKUM_CACHE_KEYLESS_ISSUER` | (none) | Expected OIDC issuer for keyless cache verification. |
| `--cache-verify-strict` | — | — | `false` | Strict cache verification: fail build if candidate cache tag has invalid signature instead of falling back to clean rebuild. |

Positional: `[dir]` — project directory, defaults to `.`.

Reads environment variables: `POKKUM_DOCKER_REPO` (required for push mode), `POKKUM_DOCKER_TAGS` (comma-splitting fallback for `--tag`), `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (reproducible build timestamp), `POKKUM_CACHE_DIR` (custom base cache directory for layers and runtime binaries; defaults to `~/.cache/pokkum`), `POKKUM_SOURCEMAP` (enable source map preservation), `POKKUM_STUB_LAUNCHER` (compile minimal entrypoint launcher stub), `POKKUM_SIGNING_KEY` (private signing key, PEM text or file path — fallback for `--signing-key`), `POKKUM_SIGNING_PUBKEY` (public key fallback used when verifying Pokkum's own signed images, both in `pokkum verify` and in remote-cache-hit verification's fallback chain — see §1's convention note and §13), `POKKUM_CACHE_PUBKEY` (static public key for remote cache verification), `POKKUM_CACHE_VERIFY_MODE`, `POKKUM_CACHE_KEYLESS_IDENTITY`, `POKKUM_CACHE_KEYLESS_ISSUER`, and `POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY` (static public key for base-image verification, also a fallback link in the same-purpose chains above).

**Automatic `$env/static/*` detection (no flag):** every build scans the project's `src/` tree for `$env/static/public`/`$env/static/private` imports — SvelteKit inlines these as literal values at build time, so an image importing from them is pinned to whatever environment built it. A `Warn` names the exact bindings found, and they're stamped as a `pokkum.dev/env-baked` manifest annotation (comma-separated binding names, mirroring the existing `pokkum.dev/required-env` convention). This is a source scan, not a data-flow analysis — it does not follow a re-export or a dynamically-computed import specifier. `$env/dynamic/*` is correctly excluded (read at container startup, never baked).

**Automatic reproducibility safeguards (no flag):** any build that reaches SvelteKit through a Pokkum-authored Vite config applies two determinism fixes upstream SvelteKit does not provide on its own, both required for the "bit-for-bit reproducible" claim in [README.md](README.md) to hold: (1) SvelteKit's experimental remote-functions manifest, which it emits in unsorted map-iteration order, is sorted before it's written — left alone, two builds of identical committed source get the same entries in a different order, which changes two server chunk hashes and the image digest; (2) `kit.version.name` is pinned to `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` — SvelteKit's own default falls back to `Date.now()`, which lands in `_app/version.json` and cascades into every downstream client chunk hash. A Pokkum-authored config is reached on **two** paths: the zero-config `--inject` path (adapter not yet configured), and a passthrough path taken when the adapter is already correctly configured but the build still needs the two fixes above — both require `package.json`'s `build` script to be exactly `vite build`, for the same reason `--inject` does (see below). Two gaps remain, and both warn explicitly rather than silently shipping a non-reproducible image: a `build` script that isn't exactly `vite build` under `--no-inject` gets neither fix, and a project with a bare `sveltekit()` call *and* its own `svelte.config.js` is deliberately left unpinned (rewriting it risks discarding the project's own aliases/csp/prerender settings) — the warning names both ways out (`kit.version.name = process.env.SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, or pass adapter options inline in `sveltekit({ ... })`).

## 3a. OpenTelemetry: What `--telemetry` Actually Does (and Doesn't)

> [!NOTE]
> **Two different mechanisms, one per strategy — both real, both verified end-to-end.** `--strategy=exe` wraps the compiled entrypoint `Compile` produces (`bun build --compile`'s input), since that strategy has a compile step to wrap an import into. `--strategy=layered` (the default) has no compile step at all — it packages the SvelteKit adapter's raw build output directly and the image execs a fixed argv via the embedded Bun runtime — so instead the bootstrap file is packaged into the image and started via `bun --preload <path>` ahead of the real entrypoint. Neither mutates your real project tree.

`--telemetry` generates a small TypeScript bootstrap (never written to your real project tree — `.pokkum/otel-bootstrap.ts` for `--strategy=exe`, packaged directly into `/app/server/otel-bootstrap.ts` for `--strategy=layered`) that imports and starts a real `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` `NodeSDK` with an OTLP trace exporter, then ensures the bootstrap runs before your app's own code (a compile-time static import for `exe`, a runtime `bun --preload` for `layered`). Enable `--telemetry`, and a real OTel SDK genuinely initializes at container startup and genuinely attempts to export spans to `--otel-export`'s endpoint, for either strategy.

**What it does not do, both confirmed by actually compiling and running real code, not assumed:**

- **No automatic HTTP/framework instrumentation.** `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node` (and every package like it) works by patching Node's module loader to intercept calls — and that patching does not take effect under Bun's runtime. A real HTTP request through a Bun-compiled binary, with the patch registered as early as technically possible, produces zero spans. This is a Bun limitation, not a Pokkum bug, and nothing in Pokkum's bootstrap can work around it.
- **No metrics export (`--metrics-only` is currently non-functional).** Combining an OTLP metrics exporter with `NodeSDK` crashes at runtime once compiled via `bun build --compile` (`TypeError: Cannot call a class constructor OTLPExporterNodeBase without |new|`) — a real Bun bundler bug where the compiler produces two non-interoperable copies of a shared dependency in one binary. The bootstrap detects `--metrics-only` and logs a runtime warning rather than silently doing nothing or crashing; no metrics are exported either way. Tracked as a known limitation on [docs/items/otel-sdk-bootstrap.md](docs/items/otel-sdk-bootstrap.md).

**The SDK starting is not the same as spans existing.** Since nothing calls the SDK automatically, `--telemetry` alone produces a running exporter with nothing to export. To get real spans — including route-templated names (`/blog/[slug]`, not `/blog/hello-world`) — add this to your own `src/hooks.server.ts` (a real SvelteKit file you own; Pokkum does not generate or touch it, since safely auto-injecting into it would require either mutating your source or a much larger virtual-build-root mechanism):

```ts
// src/hooks.server.ts
import { trace, SpanStatusCode } from "@opentelemetry/api";
import type { Handle, HandleServerError } from "@sveltejs/kit";

const tracer = trace.getTracer("my-app");

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  const routeId = event.route.id ?? "unknown";
  const span = tracer.startSpan(`${event.request.method} ${routeId}`);
  span.setAttribute("http.route", routeId);
  span.setAttribute("http.method", event.request.method);
  span.setAttribute("url.path", event.url.pathname);

  try {
    const response = await resolve(event);
    span.setAttribute("http.status_code", response.status);
    if (response.status >= 500) {
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
    }
    return response;
  } catch (err) {
    span.recordException(err as Error);
    span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
    throw err;
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
};

export const handleError: HandleServerError = ({ error, event }) => {
  const span = trace.getActiveSpan();
  if (span) {
    span.recordException(error as Error);
    span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
  }
  return { message: "Internal Error" };
};
```

`trace.getTracer(...)`/`trace.getActiveSpan()` are OpenTelemetry's own global API — this snippet needs nothing from Pokkum beyond `@opentelemetry/api` being installed (see below) and `--telemetry` having started the SDK it exports through.

**Your project must have these npm packages installed** (`bun add -D` or `-d`, matching whichever the rest of your dependencies use) for a `--telemetry` build to compile at all — Pokkum's compile step does not install them for you, and a hermetic build (`--hermetic`) cannot reach the network to do so even if it tried:

- `@opentelemetry/api`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-proto`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base`

If you use the `hooks.server.ts` snippet above, `@opentelemetry/api` is also a direct dependency of your own source, not just the generated bootstrap.

## 4. `pokkum resolve` / `pokkum apply`

| Flag | Shorthand | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--file` | `-f` | (required) | File or directory of Kubernetes manifests; `-` reads stdin. |
| `--recursive` | — | `false` | Process YAML files in the directory recursively. |
| `--security-context` | — | `true` | Inject hardened `securityContext` defaults for pokkum-built containers. |
| `--no-security-context` | — | `false` | Disable securityContext injection; wins over `--security-context` if both are set. |
| `--network-policy` | — | `true` | Generate NetworkPolicy document restricting ingress and egress, `podSelector` scoped to the workload's own Pod-template labels when found. |
| `--no-network-policy` | — | `false` | Disable NetworkPolicy generation. |
| `--resource-defaults` | — | `true` | Inject default CPU/memory requests and limits and append a PodDisruptionBudget, selector-scoped to the workload (skipped entirely if no labels are found — never emitted namespace-wide). |
| `--no-resource-defaults` | — | `false` | Disable resource default injection and PodDisruptionBudget generation. |
| `--probe-defaults` | — | `true` | Inject `readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe`/`startupProbe` defaults (`httpGet` against the supervisor's `/readyz`/`/healthz` on port `8081`) for pokkum-built containers, checked independently per probe type — a container with its own `livenessProbe` still gets `readinessProbe`/`startupProbe` filled in. See §19b. |
| `--no-probe-defaults` | — | `false` | Disable probe default injection. |
| `--cluster-inspect` | — | `true` | (`apply` only) Query live cluster workload annotations before resolution to seed multi-generation deployment history. |
| `--no-cluster-inspect` | — | `false` | (`apply` only) Disable live cluster annotation inspection; wins over `--cluster-inspect` if both are set. |
| `--since` | — | (none) | Git ref (commit, branch, tag) to diff against for monorepo affected-detection: a `pokkum://` project whose source tree has not changed since this ref, and for which a prior digest is known (from the manifest's `pokkum.dev/current-image` annotation or live cluster state when inspecting), skips compilation/packaging and reuses that digest. If no prior digest is known, or the project is affected, it is built normally. Fail-closed: an unknown ref or git failure errors out. |
| `--registry-config` | — | (none) | Path to a `docker config.json`-style auth file, keyed by registry hostname; see the `pokkum build` flag table above for the exact merge behavior. |

---

## 4b. `pokkum deploy [dir]`

Hands an image that is **already in a registry** to the PaaS control plane configured under `deploy:` in `.pokkum.yaml`. It builds nothing and pushes nothing. A successful `pokkum build` runs the same deploy automatically unless `deploy.auto` is `false` or `--no-deploy` is passed.

| Flag | Shorthand | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--dir` | `-d` | `.` | Path to the project directory holding `.pokkum.yaml`. |
| `--profile` | `-P` | (none) | Configuration profile whose `deploy:` settings to use — the same profile resolution `pokkum build` performs, so `deploy -P production` addresses the environment `build -P production` publishes to. |
| `--image` | — | (none) | Image reference to deploy, overriding configuration. Required when the target repoints the application at a specific image (`deploy.update_image: true`). |

### `deploy:` keys in `.pokkum.yaml`

Available at the top level and inside any `profiles.<name>` block. **No key holds a credential** — tokens are named indirectly, as environment variables, because `.pokkum.yaml` is a committed file and Pokkum's own `secretguard` exists to stop secrets landing in source control.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target` | (none) | `dokploy` or `swiftwave`. Empty disables deployment entirely. |
| `method` | per-target | `api` or `webhook`. Defaults to `api` for Dokploy and `webhook` for SwiftWave. Dokploy does not support `webhook` (its per-application webhook is a git-provider callback and redeploys from git, not from a Pokkum-built image); the combination is rejected at `pokkum config validate` time. |
| `endpoint` | (none) | Panel base URL for `method: api` (e.g. `https://panel.example.com`), or the complete per-application webhook URL for `method: webhook`. One of `endpoint`/`endpoint_env` is required. |
| `endpoint_env` | (none) | Name of an environment variable holding `endpoint`; wins over `endpoint` when set. Use this for a webhook URL, which carries its own secret in the path. |
| `application` | (none) | Platform-side application id. Required for `method: api`; ignored for `webhook`, where the id is already in the URL. |
| `token_env` | `POKKUM_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Name of the environment variable holding the API credential — a Dokploy API key (`x-api-key`) or a SwiftWave JWT (`Authorization: Bearer`). Unused for `method: webhook`. A named-but-empty variable is an error, not a fallback to anonymous. |
| `auto` | `true` when `target` is set | Whether a successful `pokkum build` deploys on its own. Auto-deploy never fires for `--dry-run`, `--print-manifest`, `--no-deploy`, or any output mode other than a registry push — `--local`, `--tarball` and `--to-oci-layout` leave nothing a remote PaaS can pull. |
| `update_image` | `false` | Repoint the application at the exact digest just pushed before triggering the rollout. **Dokploy `api` only**; rejected for any other combination rather than silently ignored. See the warning below. |
| `registry_url` | (none) | Registry hostname written alongside the image when `update_image` is on. |
| `registry_username_env` / `registry_password_env` | (none) | Names of the environment variables holding the registry pull credentials to write when `update_image` is on. Must both be set or both be empty. |
| `timeout` | `60s` | Go duration bounding the deploy call. |

> [!WARNING]
> **`update_image: true` overwrites Dokploy's stored registry credentials.** Dokploy's `application.saveDockerProvider` is a full overwrite, not a patch: its handler writes `dockerImage`, `username`, `password` **and** `registryUrl` from the request on every call, and its input schema marks all of them required. Pokkum therefore sends explicit values for all of them — so leaving `registry_username_env`/`registry_password_env` unset **clears** whatever credentials the application was pulling with. That is safe only for a publicly pullable image. Pokkum warns on the build log and in the deploy detail when it does this, rather than clearing them silently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **SwiftWave cannot be repointed at a new image, so pin its application to a mutable tag.** Both SwiftWave paths (`webhook` and the `rebuildApplication` GraphQL mutation) rebuild the application's *current* deployment; neither can change which reference it pulls. Configure the SwiftWave application with a tag Pokkum republishes (`:latest`, `:main`) and the deploy will make it pull that tag again.
>
> SwiftWave's webhook additionally only rebuilds when the **posted request body contains the application's own configured image**, reduced to `owner/name` — otherwise it answers `HTTP 200` with the body `OK - No rebuild` and does nothing. Pokkum posts the pushed references as the body and classifies on the response text, reporting `OK - No rebuild` as a **failure** (`ERR_DEPLOY_NOT_TRIGGERED`) rather than reading the `200` as success.

### Deploy exit conditions

A deploy that the platform accepts without starting a rollout fails the command. `pokkum build`'s automatic deploy fails the build the same way: the image is already pushed at that point and nothing rolls it back, but a `pokkum build` that exits `0` while its configured deployment did not happen is not usable as a CI gate. With `--output=json`, the failure carries a specific code: `ERR_DEPLOY_NOT_TRIGGERED`, `ERR_DEPLOY_TOKEN_MISSING`, `ERR_DEPLOY_NOT_CONFIGURED`, `ERR_INVALID_DEPLOY_TARGET`, `ERR_INVALID_DEPLOY_METHOD`, or `ERR_DEPLOY_FAILED`.

## 5. `pokkum dev [dir]`

| Flag | Shorthand | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--debug` | — | `false` | Drop into an interactive shell inside the container environment. |
| `--port` | `-p` | `3000:3000` | Port mapping for local container execution. |
| `--watch` | — | `true` | Watch source directory and auto-rebuild container on file changes. |
| `--env-file` | — | (none) | Path to an environment file for container execution. |
| `--cluster` | — | `false` | **In-pod dev loop.** Build the project and stream `/app/server` and `/app/client` straight into an already-running pod via `kubectl exec`, then restart the in-pod application process. No image is built, nothing is pushed to a registry, and the pod is never recreated. Requires `kubectl` on `PATH`, `--namespace`, `--selector`, a `--strategy=layered` image, and `POKKUM_DEV_MODE=1` on the target container (see §"Environment Variables (Runtime, Read by Supervisor)"). Mutually exclusive with `--no-container`; rejects `--debug`, `--platform`, `--bun-version` and `--bun-variant` (no image is built); warns on `--port`, `--watch`, `--env-file` and `--bun-binary`. |
| `--namespace` | — | (none) | Kubernetes namespace holding the pod to sync into. Required with `--cluster`, and a usage error without it — a loop that hot-patches a running pod never guesses which one. |
| `--selector` | — | (none) | Label selector identifying the pod to sync into, in `kubectl -l` syntax (e.g. `app=storefront`). Required with `--cluster`. Matching pods are filtered to `Running`, non-terminating ones and sorted by name; the first is used, so repeated runs against a multi-replica Deployment keep hitting the same replica instead of leaving the rest stale. |
| `--container` | — | (none) | Container within the matched pod to sync into. Required only when the pod runs more than one container (e.g. with `--with-otel-sidecar`), where there is deliberately no "first container" heuristic. |

### 5a. `pokkum dev --cluster` in practice

`--cluster` is the SvelteKit analogue of hot-swapping a binary in a running pod. One cycle is: build the project once (SvelteKit build only — no `bun build --compile`, no layer construction, no packaging), stream the resulting `/app/client` and then `/app/server` trees into the pod as a tar over `kubectl exec`, and signal the in-pod `pokkum-init` to stop the application process and start a fresh one. Then it watches `src/` and repeats.

**Why the image needs to cooperate.** A Pokkum image is distroless: it has no shell and no `tar`, so `kubectl cp` — which shells out to `tar` *inside* the container — cannot work against it, and there is nothing in the image able to kill and re-exec the server. Both halves are therefore provided by `pokkum-init` itself, the one executable already in every layered image:

- `pokkum-init __dev-sync --root DIR [--root DIR...] [--restart]` reads a tar from stdin and extracts it into the named directories, which must already exist. Entries outside every `--root` are refused, and writes go through `os.Root`, so neither a `../` name nor a symlink planted by an earlier sync can escape.
- `SIGHUP` stops the application process (`SIGTERM`, then the ordinary `POKKUM_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` grace period, then `SIGKILL`) and starts a replacement in its place, rather than being relayed to the child.

Both are gated on `POKKUM_DEV_MODE`, are off by default, and are never set by the packager.

**What it costs.** Three consequences are deliberate and are logged at `Warn` when they apply:

1. The patched pod no longer matches the image it was started from, and every change is lost the moment the pod is replaced. This is a development loop, not a deployment.
2. Extraction restores the owner write bit on the `/app` directories it writes into (the packager ships them `0555`) and leaves synced entries at `0755`/`0644`. The container user must own the `/app` tree; if it does not, the sync fails rather than half-completing.
3. If the target container sets `POKKUM_ATTESTATION_DIGEST`, the pod will fail its **next** start with exit **125**, because startup attestation re-derives the digest of the very `/app` tree this loop rewrote. The running pod is unaffected — attestation runs once, at supervisor startup — but an eviction, node drain or OOM kill turns into a crash loop. Delete and redeploy the pod to recover.

**What it does not do.** Deletions are not propagated: a file removed from the local build stays in the pod until the pod is replaced. `/app/prerendered`, `/app/vendor`, `/app/native` and `/app/node_modules` are not synced — a change to production dependencies needs a real image build. `--cluster` requires a layered image; against an `exe` or `static` image the extractor refuses, because the `--root` directories it is asked to write into do not exist.

## 6. `pokkum doctor [dir]`

| Flag | Shorthand | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--dir` | `-d` | `.` | Path to SvelteKit project directory. |
| `--fix` | — | `false` | Automatically repair mechanical issues (e.g. create default `.pokkumignore`). |

---

## 7. `pokkum init [dir]`

Initializes a SvelteKit workspace for Pokkum by creating `.pokkum.yaml` (with default configuration and build profiles) and `.pokkumignore`.

**Init reads your project before it asks you anything.** Two analyses run first, and their results become the prompt defaults — so the questions that the source code can answer arrive pre-answered, with the evidence shown:

| Analysis | What it reads | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| Static viability | Every route source under `kit.files.routes` (default `src/routes`), plus `*.remote.ts\|js` anywhere and `src/hooks.server.*` | Whether `strategy: static` is possible at all |
| Runtime | `packageManager` in `package.json`, then lockfiles, then `engines` | `runtime: bun` vs `runtime: node`, and the base preset that carries it |

The static-viability scan is a **disqualifier** scan. It reports what rules a static build out, and it is sound in that direction only: "nothing found" means nothing in your source needs a server, not that a static build is guaranteed to succeed (a load function calling a runtime-only API, or a dynamic route with no links for the crawler to follow, still fails later). It reports three outcomes, and they are deliberately distinct — a project it could not scan is reported as *unknown*, never as viable.

What counts as needing a server:

| Found | Blocks static? |
|---|---|
| `+server.*` exporting POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE or QUERY | Yes — SvelteKit: *"Cannot prerender a +server file with … handlers"* |
| `+server.*` exporting only GET / HEAD / OPTIONS | **No** — SvelteKit prerenders read-only endpoints to static responses |
| A route directory holding **both** a `+page.*` and a `+server.*` | Yes — SvelteKit: *"Cannot prerender a route with both +page and +server files"* |
| `export const actions` — form actions | Yes, unconditionally — SvelteKit: *"Cannot prerender pages with actions"*. No flag retires it |
| A `load` in `+page.server.*` / `+layout.server.*` | **No** — server loads run at build time, which is how a static site reads a CMS or the filesystem |
| `*.remote.ts\|js` using `query()`, `form()` or `command()` | Yes |
| `*.remote.ts\|js` using only `prerender()` | No — that resolves at build time and ships as data |
| `export const prerender = false` anywhere | Yes — the one finding a source edit retires |
| `hooks.server.*` | No, reported as a caveat — server hooks run during prerendering, so the build works; what you lose is per-request behaviour for real visitors |
| A dynamic route (`[slug]`, `[...rest]`, `[[optional]]`) with no `entries()` export | No, reported as a caveat — SvelteKit prerenders it if the crawler reaches it, so a linked route builds fine. But an unreachable one **fails the build** (the default `handleUnseenRoutes` throws), and whether a route is linked cannot be determined from source. Export `entries()`, or list the paths in `config.prerender.entries`. Suppressed if the project sets `prerender.handleUnseenRoutes` to `warn` or `ignore` |

These rules are SvelteKit's own, read from `@sveltejs/kit`'s source (`src/core/postbuild/analyse.js`, `src/runtime/server/page/index.js`, `src/constants.js`) rather than inferred — they are the complete set of conditions under which it refuses to prerender.

Matching ignores comments and string literals, so a commented-out `export const prerender = false` does not count.

When nothing rules static out but the project is not set up to build that way, init says which of the two prerequisites is missing — `@sveltejs/adapter-static` in `package.json`, and `export const prerender = true` in the routes root's `+layout.ts`.

Interactive sessions (TTY) then ask six questions: target registry, build strategy, **application runtime** (skipped for `strategy: static`, which ships no JavaScript runtime), base image preset (each shown with a one-line rationale, detected default marked), local profile, and CVE gating policy. `--defaults` takes every detected default without prompting — so `pokkum init --defaults` still gets the analysed strategy and runtime, it just does not ask.

`runtime`, `strategy` and `base` are written as a composition, not three independent choices: `runtime: node` requires `strategy: layered` and a base that ships a Node binary, so init upgrades the base to `distroless-node` alongside it and never writes it next to `strategy: static`.

| Flag | Shorthand | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--dir` | `-d` | `.` | Path to SvelteKit project directory. |
| `--defaults` | — | `false` | Accept default initialization settings without interactive prompts. Detection still runs; only the questions are skipped. |
| `--output` | — | `text` | Output serialization format (`text` or `json`). |

---

### Static-build preflight

Before `pokkum build --strategy=static` spawns anything, Pokkum scans the project for source SvelteKit refuses to prerender and **refuses the build** if it finds any, listing every offending file:

```
--strategy=static ships no server, but 2 files in this project cannot be prerendered
  - src/routes/api/+server.ts exports a POST handler, and SvelteKit cannot prerender a
    +server file with a handler whose response depends on the request body
  - src/routes/signup/+page.server.ts declares form actions, which handle POST requests
    at runtime and cannot be prerendered

Build with --strategy=layered to ship a server, or remove the code above.
```

Without this the same project fails minutes later, inside SvelteKit's build, with a message that names neither Pokkum nor the strategy setting that caused it.

Three deliberate limits, because a preflight that over-rejects is worse than none:

| Limit | Why |
|---|---|
| `--strategy=static` only | Every other strategy ships a server, so none of these findings apply |
| Only refuses on a **blocked** verdict, never on **unknown** | An unreadable project, or one with no routes directory, is the *absence* of evidence. Pokkum has blocked every real project this way once before and will not do it again |
| `--allow-server-code-in-static` overrides it | The scan is a heuristic over source text. If it is ever wrong, nobody should have to wait for a Pokkum release to ship |

The rules it applies are SvelteKit's own — see the table under `pokkum init` for the full list. Setting `build.allow_server_code_in_static: true` in `.pokkum.yaml` is equivalent to passing the flag on every build, and can be turned back off in a named profile.

---

## 8. `pokkum config`

Subcommand group to inspect and validate project configuration files (`.pokkum.yaml`). See `testdata/config/pokkum.yaml.golden` for a fully-commented, schema-complete example (base config plus `local`/`production`-style profiles) — it is parsed and validated end-to-end by tests in both `internal/adapters/config` and `cmd/pokkum`, so it cannot drift out of sync with the schema below.

| Subcommand / Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pokkum config view [dir]` | — | Resolves and prints the active configuration after evaluating defaults and environment bindings. |
| `pokkum config view --profile <name>` | — | Resolves and prints configuration with the specified named profile overrides applied. |
| `pokkum config schema` | — | Writes the JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for `.pokkum.yaml` to stdout, embedded in the binary at build time so it describes the configuration *this* version accepts. Flag-free; redirect to a file (`pokkum config schema > .pokkum.schema.json`). Generated from `ports.ProjectConfig`/`ports.BuildProfile` by `scripts/gen-schema` — see `schema/pokkum.schema.json`, and note it encodes field/type/enum/unknown-key rules but not cross-field composition, which `config validate` enforces. |
| `pokkum config validate [dir]` | — | Validates syntax, schema version, presets, and platform strings, both at the top level AND for every named profile in `profiles:` (a profile-only mistake, e.g. an invalid `strategy` set only inside `profiles.production`, is caught and reported as `profile "production": ...`, not silently ignored). Also rejects unknown/misspelled top-level or nested keys (`gopkg.in/yaml.v3`'s `KnownFields(true)`) and validates `docker.repo` (base and per-profile) as a syntactically valid registry reference via `go-containerregistry/pkg/name`. |
| `--profile`, `-P` | (none) | (`view` only) Profile to resolve and display. |
| `--dir`, `-d` | `.` | Path to SvelteKit project directory. |
| `--output` | `text` | Output serialization format (`text` or `json`). |

---

### `pokkum deploy --check`

Validates the deploy configuration and **deploys nothing**. It resolves the request through `core.ResolveDeployRequest` — the same call a real deploy makes — so agreeing with `--check` means the same resolution will succeed.

```
=== pokkum deploy --check ===
Target: dokploy (method api)

  ✓ configuration  target dokploy, method api, resolved by the same code `pokkum deploy` runs
  ✓ credential     POKKUM_DEPLOY_TOKEN is set (18 characters) — presence only; Pokkum does not ask dokploy whether it is accepted
  ? application    "abc123" is set and syntactically usable, but Pokkum cannot confirm it exists
  ? endpoint       panel.example.com:443 accepted a TCP connection — reachability only

✓ Nothing is wrong with what Pokkum can check, but 2 item(s) could not be verified.
```

**Three outcomes per item, and `?` is not `✓`.** `unverified` means Pokkum could not test that item; it is reported distinctly and never fails the command, because treating "could not determine" as an error would make `--check` unusable for the configurations it exists to help with. Only a `✗` exits non-zero.

What each item does and does not prove:

| Item | Verifies | Does **not** verify |
|---|---|---|
| configuration | The full resolution a deploy performs: target, method, endpoint, `endpoint_env`, token presence, `application`, `update_image` support, registry credential pairing | — |
| credential | The named environment variable is set, and its length | That the platform accepts it |
| application | It is set and syntactically usable | That it exists. Confirming that needs a read-only endpoint, and every Dokploy endpoint whose contract Pokkum has verified against Dokploy's source **mutates** (`application.deploy` queues a rollout, `application.saveDockerProvider` overwrites credentials). A check must not deploy |
| endpoint | The host resolves and accepts a TCP connection | That anything is listening on the right path, or that the credential works. No request is sent — which is also what makes it safe for a webhook endpoint whose URL path *is* the secret |

No credential, token or webhook URL ever appears in the output; the endpoint is reported as `host:port` only.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--check` | `false` | Validate the deploy configuration and report what would happen, without deploying. |
| `--offline` | `false` | With `--check`, skip the endpoint reachability probe and validate configuration only. |

---

## 9. `pokkum explain` / `pokkum explain why` / `pokkum explain diff`

`why` and `diff` are subcommands of `explain`, not top-level commands — the invocation is `pokkum explain why ...` / `pokkum explain diff ...`.

| Command / Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pokkum explain <image>` | — | Reads a real image (registry ref, or a local `.tar` from `pokkum build --tarball <path>`) and reports its actual per-layer digest, compressed size, real file count, and purpose (derived from the image's own history metadata for layers Pokkum built). The layer count printed is whatever the image actually has. |
| `pokkum explain why <image> <file-path>` | — | Traces which real layer a file came from, was deleted in (via a whiteout), or reports it was never present in any layer. |
| `pokkum explain diff <image1> <image2>` | — | Compares two real images' manifests and, for any layer whose digest differs, reports real added/removed/modified files. |
| `--platform` (`-p`) | host platform | On all three: which child image to inspect when the target is a multi-arch index, e.g. `linux/amd64`. |
| `--registry-config` | — | On all three: path to a `docker config.json`-style auth file for private registries. |

---

## 10. `pokkum scan [target]`

`pokkum scan` inspects project directories, container images (e.g. `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot`), or OCI tarballs (`image.tar`). For images and tarballs, it enumerates OS packages (Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, Wolfi, Chainguard) and toolchain packages using native zero-dependency targeted parsers (`scannerutils`), querying OSV.dev via batch API (`/v1/querybatch`) for CVE lookups and CVSS severity scoring.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--fail-on` | `critical` | Minimum vulnerability severity threshold causing scan failure (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`). |
| `--toolchain` | `false` | Restrict scan to embedded Bun and SvelteKit toolchain advisories. |
| `--output` | `text` | Output serialization format (`text` or `json`). |
| `--offline` | `false` | Disable remote vulnerability database queries and use embedded advisories. |
| `--allow-incomplete` | `false` | Report success even if a vulnerability database lookup **fails** (default: fail closed on reduced coverage). Does not apply to `--offline`, which skips lookups by design: an offline scan is always reported as incomplete but still exits 0, so gate on the `incomplete` field rather than the exit code there. |

---

## 11. `pokkum rollback`

Updates image references in Kubernetes deployment manifests across multiple generations using `pokkum.dev/image-history` and `pokkum.dev/previous-image` annotations.

| Flag | Shorthand | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--file` | `-f` | (required) | Manifest file to roll back. |
| `--to` | — | (optional) | Target container image reference or digest to roll back to (overrides generation index). |
| `--generation` | `-g` | `1` | Number of generations back to roll back (default `1` = immediate previous image). |
| `--list` | — | `false` | List available historical image generations recorded in manifest annotations. |
| `--output` | — | `text` | Output format (`text` or `json`). |

---

## 12. `pokkum upgrade`

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--check` | `false` | Check for available CLI updates without installing. |
| `--version` | (latest) | Target version to upgrade to. |
| `--output` | `text` | Output format (`text` or `json`). |
| `--offline` | `false` | Disable network calls to release API (returns `Verified: false`). |
| `--key` | (embedded) | Path to public key PEM file for release artifact signature verification. Overrides the embedded `DefaultReleasePublicKeyPEM`, which must match this repo's `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` CI secret — see [docs/archive/for-users.md](docs/archive/for-users.md). |

Without `--check`, `pokkum upgrade` refuses to install anything if it cannot verify the release signature (fails closed, including when no verifier is configured at all) — it does not fall back to an unverified install.

---


## 13. `pokkum verify` / `pokkum repro doctor`

| Command / Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pokkum verify <ref>` | — | Performs attestation summary and signature validation. |
| `--no-rebuild` | `false` | Skip full image rebuild during verification. |
| `--against <path>` | (none) | Local image tarball or ref to compare against. |
| `--expect-source <repo>@<ref>` | (none) | Assert the expected git repository and commit. **Requires a cryptographically verified SLSA `source-code` attestation** — it refuses to run (exit 2) rather than comparing against the image's own unsigned `org.opencontainers.image.source`/`.revision` annotations, which anyone able to push to the repo controls. Sign builds (`pokkum build --sign`) so there is something real to check, or pass `--allow-unverified-source` to compare anyway. The repository half is an exact match on the normalized form (never a substring match — `github.com/acme/app` does not match `github.com/evil/github.com/acme/app`). The commit half is a **prefix** match, so an abbreviated SHA works, but it is bounded: an assertion shorter than 7 characters (git's own default abbreviation length) is rejected outright as too ambiguous to assert anything, and a clean-commit assertion (no `-dirty` suffix) is never satisfied by a `-dirty` provenance record even though the clean SHA is textually a prefix of `<sha>-dirty` — assert `<commit>-dirty` explicitly if that is what you mean. |
| `--allow-unverified-source` | `false` | Permit `--expect-source` to compare against unsigned image annotations when no verified SLSA source attestation exists. The comparison still runs and a mismatch still fails, but the result is explicitly marked unverified — `Source Verify: UNVERIFIED (unsigned image annotations only)` in text output, `pinned_inputs.source_provenance` in JSON — and a `Warn` is logged. Escape hatch for pre-signing images; not a substitute for verification. |
| `--keyless-identity` | (none) | Expected Fulcio certificate Subject Alternative Name for keyless signature verification. **Required** to verify a keyless-signed image — without it, verification of keyless material is refused outright rather than accepting any Fulcio signer on earth (fixed 2026-08-18; see below). |
| `--keyless-issuer` | (none) | Expected OIDC issuer URL for keyless signature verification (e.g. `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`). Required alongside `--keyless-identity`; a half-configured pair fails before any network I/O. |
| `--public-key` | (none) | Path or PEM string for the static Cosign public key to verify a static-key-signed image's signature against. Falls back to `POKKUM_SIGNING_PUBKEY` → `POKKUM_BASE_IMAGE_PUBKEY`, **no fallback beyond that as of 2026-08-18** (commit `a149b28`) — see §1's convention note. If the image carries a static-key signature and none of these resolve to a key, `pokkum verify` now hard-fails with `ErrStaticKeyRequired` naming this flag/the two env vars, **in every mode including the default rebuild-and-compare path**. This closes a real fail-open: before this fix, the same situation silently produced `SignatureValid: false` with a `nil` error, so the rebuild/comparison logic never actually gated on signature validity at all for a static-key-signed image with no key configured — a breaking change, but one that closes a real gap rather than merely tightening an already-enforced check. |
| `--sigstore-trusted-root` | (none) | Path to a Sigstore trusted-root JSON snapshot to verify keyless material against, instead of the embedded public-good snapshot. An unreadable path fails closed rather than silently falling back to the embedded root. |
| `pokkum repro doctor [dir]` | — | Stage-level non-determinism bisection diagnostic wizard. |
| `--fast` | `false` | Run fast static reproducibility checks. |
| `--perturb` | `false` | **Not implemented — refuses.** It was intended to inject environmental perturbations and run dual builds to bisect stage-level non-determinism, but no build was ever performed: the flag was echoed into the output and never read, so it reported the same `preflight passed` as every other mode. It now returns an error rather than claiming a pass it did not earn. To compare real rebuilds, use `pokkum verify` (rebuilds by default; opt out with `--no-rebuild`). |

**Fixed 2026-08-18 — keyless verification used to derive its expected identity from the certificate it was verifying** (`Issuer.CommonName`, the CA's own name, compared against itself in every real case), making the keyless path dead code that failed identically for genuine and forged signatures. The expected identity now comes exclusively from `--keyless-identity`/`--keyless-issuer`, never from the artifact under verification — see `Lessons.md`'s 2026-08-18 entry for why the seemingly-obvious fix (reading the *correct* certificate field instead) would have been worse than the original bug.

**Known gap: `pokkum verify` is not `--asset-overlay`-aware.** `verify` has no `--asset-overlay`/`--asset-overlay-from` flags, and its rebuild path does not reconstruct the overlay layer at all. Running `pokkum verify <ref>` against an image that was originally built with `--asset-overlay` will report the overlay layer's content as a digest mismatch against the plain rebuild — a false positive, not evidence of tampering. There is currently no workaround short of `--no-rebuild` (attestation/signature checks only, skipping the byte comparison). Closing this is tracked in `docs/archive/AdditionalFeatures.md`; see also `docs/Roadmap.md`'s Tier 1.1 entry.

---

## 14. `pokkum base`

| Subcommand / Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pokkum base update [--preset <name>] [--mirror-registry <repo>]` | — | Re-resolve upstream base image tags against remote registry and update `pokkum.lock`. If `--mirror-registry=<repo>` is supplied, copies the base image/index and its Cosign `.sig` tag into the project-controlled mirror repo, recording `mirror_ref` in `pokkum.lock`. Does **not** run signature verification during update — the resolved digest is pinned on trust-on-first-use; `pokkum build` re-verifies the locked digest against the live signature at build time regardless. **As of 2026-08-18 (commit `a149b28`), that build-time re-verification also covers the mirror path**: `pokkum build` compares the digest the mirror actually serves against the `digest` locked in `pokkum.lock` and fails closed (naming both digests) on mismatch — closing a prior gap where `mirror_ref` (a mutable tag) was pulled without ever checking it against the locked digest, so a mirror with push access could serve a different, older, but still genuinely-signed image and pass every check. |
| `pokkum base check` | — | Inspect current base image lockfile status and digest pinning. Same no-verification caveat as `base update` above. |

---

## 14b. `pokkum guide [topic]`

Prints the operating manual for driving Pokkum from inside a SvelteKit project. Unlike this document, it is compiled into the binary, so it always describes the version that printed it — the skew this closes is a Homebrew-installed release whose bundled README predates a whole command group.

Its audience is explicitly someone (or some agent) working in a *project* rather than in this repository, who cannot read `Vocabulary.md` at all. It therefore restates configuration and flag material found here on purpose. `cmd/pokkum/guide_test.go` keeps that duplication honest: every `yaml:` field of `ports.ProjectConfig`/`ports.BuildProfile` must appear in the guide's `config` section (70 fields at time of writing), and every command in the cobra tree must be named in it. `cmd/pokkum/flagmentions_test.go` additionally rejects any flag mention in the guide that does not correspond to a real, registered flag.

No flags. `pokkum guide` prints every section; `pokkum guide <topic>` prints one; `pokkum guide topics` lists them. An unknown topic is a usage error naming the valid set.

| Topic | Contents |
|---|---|
| `overview` | What Pokkum is operationally, what enters the image, the command list |
| `quickstart` | The path from nothing to a running image, each step ending at a check |
| `invariants` | The five properties that constrain application code before Pokkum runs |
| `config` | The complete `.pokkum.yaml` field reference, precedence, and the runtime/strategy/base composition rule |
| `strategy` | `static` vs `layered`, and exactly what the viability scan does and does not prove |
| `base` | Base image presets and custom references |
| `output` | Output modes, and what each one loses |
| `deploy` | Kubernetes, Dokploy, SwiftWave and vanilla registry-pull recipes |
| `env` | Environment variables, CLI-side and runtime |
| `verify` | Proving what you built, including `explain why` and running as the real UID |
| `extras` | Extra project files, and the third-party-binary case Pokkum does not cover |
| `escape-hatches` | What each bypass flag actually turns off |
| `failures` | Error text → meaning → next command |
| `non-goals` | What Pokkum will not do, so nobody hunts for the flag |

---

## 15. `pokkum version`

No flags.

---

## 16. `pokkum adopt [dir]`

Migration codemod that inspects an existing SvelteKit repository (configured for `@sveltejs/adapter-node`, `adapter-vercel`, `adapter-auto`, `adapter-cloudflare`, etc.), updates `package.json` dependencies and `svelte.config.js` to Pokkum compilation defaults, generates `.pokkumignore`, and optionally removes legacy Dockerfile configurations. `package.json` edits go through an order-preserving JSON model rather than `map[string]any` (which Go sorts): unrelated keys and array/object members keep their original order **at every depth**, not just at the top level, so `adopt` only ever adds/changes the entries it means to. For a third-party adapter, the config rewrite traces the identifier actually bound as `adapter: X()` and replaces whichever import binds it, rather than pattern-matching on the `@sveltejs/adapter-*` package name — matching on the package name alone produced a second, duplicate `adapter` import for any adapter outside that naming convention (e.g. `svelte-adapter-bun`), which broke the rewritten config with "Identifier 'adapter' has already been declared."

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--dir`, `-d` | `.` | Path to SvelteKit project directory. |
| `--dry-run` | `false` | Report planned migration changes without writing to disk. |
| `--remove-dockerfile` | `false` | Remove legacy Dockerfile, `.dockerignore`, and compose files. |
| `--write-config` | `false` | Also permanently rewrite `svelte.config.js` on disk. Not required for `pokkum build`, which injects the adapter **configuration** through a virtual `.pokkum/vite.config.ts` wrapper at build time (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s Zero-Mutation Build Sandbox) — this flag exists for cases where the adapter swap being visible in the real file matters anyway (e.g. editor tooling). **Injection configures an adapter; it cannot install one**, and it declines unless `package.json`'s `build` script is exactly `vite build`. Otherwise `pokkum build` stops with `sveltekit adapter missing`/`misconfigured` and names the precondition that failed — see §3's `--inject`. |
| `--output` | `text` | Output serialization format (`text` or `json`). |

## 17. `pokkum history <image>`

Reads a published image's real OCI annotations — the git commit, repository, build timestamp and base image baked into that specific image — and reports which manifest they were read from. It does **not** verify signatures or SLSA attestations; use `pokkum verify <ref>` for a cryptographic verdict.

Both output formats show the complete annotation set and its source. (`--expect-source` and `--allow-unverified-source` were previously listed here in error; they are `pokkum verify` flags and `history` has never accepted them.)

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--registry-config` | (none) | Path to a docker `config.json`-style auth file for private registries. |
| `--output` | `text` | Output format (`text` or `json`). |

For a multi-platform image the ref `pokkum build` prints is the *index* digest, whose own manifest carries only a subset of the annotations; `history` descends into a child manifest to recover the rest and always discloses that it did, via `annotations_source` (`manifest`, `index+child-manifest`, or `index-only`).

---

## 17b. Environment Variables (CLI, Deploy)

Read by `pokkum deploy` and by `pokkum build`'s automatic deploy. Only the *names* are configured in `.pokkum.yaml`; the values live in the environment.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POKKUM_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | — | Default source of the PaaS API credential when `deploy.token_env` is unset: a Dokploy API key or a SwiftWave JWT. Point `deploy.token_env` at a different variable to override the name. Unused for `deploy.method: webhook`, whose secret is already inside the webhook URL. A named-but-empty variable fails the deploy rather than falling back to an unauthenticated call. |

---

## 18. Environment Variables (Runtime, Read by Supervisor)

These configure the image's *runtime* behavior inside the container (read by `/pokkum/init`), not the CLI:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the compiled app listens on. |
| `POKKUM_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log level for the supervisor's own log lines (`pokkum-init` for `--strategy=layered`/`exe`, `pokkum-static` for `--strategy=static`): `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` (case-insensitive, via `slog.Level.UnmarshalText`). An unset or unparseable value falls back to `info` with a `Warn`-level message naming the bad value. |
| `POKKUM_PROBE_PORT` | `8081` | Port the supervisor serves `/healthz` and `/readyz` on. |
| `POKKUM_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | Grace period after `SIGTERM` before `SIGKILL`. |
| `POKKUM_REQUIRED_ENV` | (none) | Comma-separated list of required environment variable names that must be present and non-empty at container boot; supervisor fails fast if any are missing. |
| `POKKUM_PRERENDERED_DIR` | (none) | Path (in the image) of the mounted prerendered pages tree. Set by the packager to `/app/prerendered` for `--strategy=layered`; the patched adapter-node handler serves prerendered pages from here. |
| `POKKUM_CLIENT_DIR` | (none) | Path (in the image) of the mounted client asset tree. Set by the packager to `/app/client` for **every** `--strategy=layered` build; the patched adapter-node handler serves stylesheets, scripts and other immutable assets from here. Without it the stock handler resolves assets relative to its own directory (`/app/server/client`), which does not exist in a Pokkum image — and because adapter-node's `serve()` returns `false` for a missing directory and the middleware chain is built with `.filter(Boolean)`, the asset handler is dropped silently: the container boots, both probes pass, `/` returns `200`, and every asset `404`s. |
| `POKKUM_DEV_MODE` | (none, i.e. off) | **Opt-in for the in-pod development loop (`pokkum dev --cluster`); never set on a production workload.** Accepts anything `strconv.ParseBool` does (`1`, `true`, `TRUE`, ...); anything else, including empty, is off. Never set by the packager — an image carries it only because an operator put it on the workload, e.g. `kubectl set env deployment/<name> POKKUM_DEV_MODE=1`. When on, two behaviours change in `pokkum-init`, and both hand real power to anyone who can already `kubectl exec` into the pod: the `pokkum-init __dev-sync` subcommand becomes callable, letting a caller overwrite the live `/app` tree from a tar on stdin; and `SIGHUP` stops the application process and starts a fresh one in its place instead of being forwarded to it. `pokkum-init` logs a `Warn`-level message naming the variable at every startup where it is set. Startup attestation is **not** disabled by it — see the interaction described in §5a. |
| `POKKUM_ATTESTATION_DIGEST` | (none) | Expected SHA-256 root digest of the layered `/app` runtime tree (startup attestation, hardening Option C). Set by the packager at build time for `--strategy=layered`. When present, `pokkum-init` re-derives the digest from the live `/app` tree before exec and refuses to start (exit **125** — see "Supervisor Exit Codes" below) on mismatch — tamper-evidence without cluster-level readonly-rootfs. Absent ⇒ verification silently disabled (deliberate escape hatch, no log). Malformed (non-empty but not 64 lowercase hex chars) ⇒ verification also disabled, but `pokkum-init` logs a `Warn`-level message naming the variable, since this means the build pipeline failed to stamp the env correctly and the security control is silently not running. Only applies to the layered strategy. |
| `POKKUM_STATIC_ROOTS` | `/app/client:/app/prerendered` | Colon-separated list of static roots that `pokkum-static` serves (via Content-Encoding/Range/ETag) for `--strategy=static` images. Set by the packager at build time. Response headers worth knowing: `Accept-Ranges: bytes` is always advertised (Range handling was already implemented but never announced, so clients that check first fell back to whole-file requests), and `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is set on **every** response for a precompressible file type, not only when a compressed sidecar was actually chosen — otherwise a shared cache could hand the identity copy to a client that would have taken the Brotli one, and the ETag differs between them, so the client gets a full 200 instead of a 304. |
| `POKKUM_STATIC_FALLBACK` | (none) | **Opt-in SPA fallback** for `--strategy=static`: an in-image file path (e.g. `/app/client/200.html`) that `pokkum-static` serves with `200` for any unmatched `GET`/`HEAD` route (same ETag/Range/Content-Encoding negotiation as any served file). Set by the packager only when the source project configures an `@sveltejs/adapter-static` `fallback` page that was actually emitted into the client staging. Absent/empty (the default) means unmatched routes keep returning a plain `404`; the server logs a one-per-process `Warn` on the first such `404` pointing at this doc. Mirrors the `-fallback` flag on the `pokkum-static` binary. |

## 18b. Environment Variables (Runtime, Read by the Application)

Unlike the table above, these are read directly by the bundled `@sveltejs/adapter-node` server itself (`handler.js`), not by `pokkum-init` — they only apply to `--strategy=layered`/`--strategy=exe`, which embed adapter-node. All are optional; adapter-node falls back to its own default for any that are unset. Set via `--origin`/`--protocol-header`/`--host-header`/`--address-header`/`--xff-depth`/`--body-size-limit` on `pokkum build`, or the matching `image.*` keys in `.pokkum.yaml`.

| Variable | Default (adapter-node's own) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ORIGIN` | (none — derived from the raw socket) | The app's own canonical origin (e.g. `https://example.com`), used to validate the `Origin` header on form-action POSTs and to build absolute URLs. **Strongly recommended for any deployment behind a reverse proxy or ingress** — without it, adapter-node derives origin/protocol from the raw socket, which reports the wrong scheme/host behind TLS termination and produces `403 Cross-site POST form submissions are forbidden` on the app's first form action. `pokkum build` logs a `Warn` at build time when this is unset for a layered/exe build. |
| `PROTOCOL_HEADER` | (none) | Proxy header adapter-node trusts for the original request protocol (e.g. `x-forwarded-proto`). |
| `HOST_HEADER` | (none) | Proxy header adapter-node trusts for the original request host (e.g. `x-forwarded-host`). |
| `ADDRESS_HEADER` | (none) | Proxy header adapter-node trusts for the real client IP (e.g. `x-forwarded-for`). Without it, `event.getClientAddress()` reports the proxy's own address for every request. |
| `XFF_DEPTH` | `1` | Number of trusted proxy hops adapter-node counts back from when parsing `ADDRESS_HEADER`. |
| `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT` | `512K` | Request body size cap, in adapter-node's own size-string format (e.g. `512K`, `10M`, `Infinity` to disable). |

---

## 18c. Filesystem Contract (Runtime)

Two properties of every image Pokkum produces. Neither is configurable, and both shape how an application must be written — they are stated here because previously they existed only as comments in `internal/adapters/packager/layer.go`, and were discovered as production failures rather than read.

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| The application tree is read-only | Files ship at mode `0555` and directories at `0555`, unconditionally, in every image and every strategy. There is no flag or config key to change it. Any runtime write to a project-relative path fails. Writes must target the OS temporary directory. |
| Only adapter output ships | Nothing else from the project directory enters the image. There is no implicit `COPY .`. A project reading templates, fonts or seed data off disk must place them inside the adapter's output directory during its own build — see `pokkum guide extras`. |

**Verify as the real runtime user.** `docker exec` defaults to root, and root bypasses the `0555` bits via `DAC_OVERRIDE` — so a command that succeeds under `docker exec` proves nothing about the non-root process actually serving traffic. Use `docker run -u 65532 …` instead. Use `pokkum explain why <image> <path>` to answer "did this file make it into the image" without starting a container at all.

---

## 18d. CLI Exit Codes (`pokkum`)

These are the codes the **CLI** returns on the machine you run it on. They are a different set from §19's, which are returned by `pokkum-init` as PID 1 *inside* a running container — the two never overlap and are never interchangeable. If you are reading an exit status off a crash-looping pod, you want §19; if you are gating a CI step on a `pokkum` command, you want this table.

| Exit code | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | The command succeeded. | normal return |
| `1` | The command failed. This is the general failure path every command shares — a build error, a refused deploy, a red `doctor`, an invalid config. | `os.Exit(1)` in `main.go` |
| `1` | For `pokkum verify` specifically: verification **ran and produced a negative verdict** — a rebuild comparison mismatch, or a comparison that could not be completed. The image was reachable and checkable; it did not pass. | `exitFunc(1)` in `verify.go` |
| `2` | For `pokkum verify` specifically: verification **could not be performed at all** — an unreadable `--sigstore-trusted-root`, an unresolvable Sigstore trust root, unresolvable provenance, or signature material that could not be characterized. This is deliberately not `1`: "checked and failed" and "could not check" must never share a code, or a CI gate cannot tell a bad image from a broken verifier. | `exitFunc(2)` in `verify.go` |
| `<N>` | For `pokkum apply` only: when the underlying `kubectl apply` fails, its exit code is propagated verbatim rather than collapsed to `1`, so an operator sees kubectl's own status. | `os.Exit(exitErr.ExitCode())` in `apply.go` |

**Cobra usage errors also exit `1`, not `2`.** An unknown command or an invalid flag value goes through the same `main.go` path as a runtime failure, so the exit status alone does not distinguish "you typed it wrong" from "it ran and failed". Gate on the error output or `--output json`'s error code, not on the status, when that distinction matters.

`cmd/pokkum/exitcodes_test.go` asserts every literal exit code reachable in `cmd/pokkum` appears in this table, so a newly introduced code cannot ship undocumented.

---

## 19. Supervisor Exit Codes (`pokkum-init`)

`pokkum-init` (PID 1 in every Pokkum-built image) terminates with one of the codes below, whether it refuses to start the child at all or is reporting the child's own termination. This is the only signal available to an operator triaging a crash-looping pod from a dashboard that shows exit status but not full logs, so each code below is deliberately distinct — none of the rows may ever be collapsed onto another.

| Exit code | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Child exited cleanly (or caught its termination signal and exited 0). | `exitCode` in `supervisor.go` |
| `1` | Child could not be started for a reason other than the specific cases below (uncommon). | `startExitCode` in `supervisor.go` |
| `2` | `pokkum-init` itself was invoked with a bad flag or missing command (usage error). | `exitUsage` in `main.go` |
| `<N>` (0–255) | Child ran and exited on its own with status `N`, propagated verbatim. | `exitCode` in `supervisor.go` |
| `125` | **Startup attestation mismatch.** `POKKUM_ATTESTATION_DIGEST` was set (non-empty, well-formed) and the live `/app` tree's re-derived digest does not match it — the filesystem was tampered with after the image was built, or the image is corrupted. The child is never exec'd. | `exitAttestationMismatch` in `main.go` |
| `126` | Child binary exists but could not be exec'd (`EACCES`/`EPERM`/`ENOEXEC` — e.g. missing execute bit, wrong architecture). **Not** used for attestation failures (see `125` above); the two were split apart specifically so this code keeps its single, pre-existing meaning. | `startExitCode` in `supervisor.go` |
| `127` | Child binary not found (`ENOENT` / not on `PATH`). | `startExitCode` in `supervisor.go` |
| `128+N` | Child was killed by signal `N` (e.g. `137` = `128+SIGKILL`, `143` = `128+SIGTERM`), including the shutdown-timeout escalation to `SIGKILL` when the child ignores the forwarded termination signal past `POKKUM_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`. | `exitCode` in `supervisor.go` |

---

## 19b. Kubernetes Probe Defaults (`pokkum resolve`/`apply --probe-defaults`)

`--probe-defaults` (default `true`) injects three probes against pokkum-init's probe server (`POKKUM_PROBE_PORT`, default `8081`) into any pokkum-built container that doesn't already define its own — checked independently per probe type, so an existing custom `livenessProbe` doesn't block `readinessProbe`/`startupProbe` from being filled in:

| Probe | Path | `periodSeconds` | `failureThreshold` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `readinessProbe` | `/readyz` (`ports.ProbePathReady`) | `3` | `3` | Traffic gating — a TCP-connect check to the app's own port; adapter-node's server (`handler.js`) resolves its module-level `await server.init(...)` — which is what runs `hooks.server.js`'s `init` hook — before `index.js` ever calls `server.listen()`, so a successful connect here already implies `init()` has completed. Carries **no `initialDelaySeconds`**: the `startupProbe` below is already the "has it started" gate, so an upfront delay would only postpone `Ready` without protecting anything. The short period is affordable because `/readyz` is served from a cached value inside `pokkum-init`, never a fresh dial, so probe traffic cannot become load on your app. |
| `livenessProbe` | `/healthz` (`ports.ProbePathLive`) | `10` | `3` | Process-alive check — restarts the container if the supervisor reports the child process as not running. |
| `startupProbe` | `/readyz` | `2` | `30` (60s total grace) | Protects a legitimately slow `init()` (a slow DB connection, a large cache warm) from being killed by `livenessProbe`'s normal cadence before the app has even finished starting — while a `startupProbe` hasn't yet succeeded once, `readinessProbe`/`livenessProbe` don't count against the container at all. |

## 20. Beyond v1.0 / Backlog

Post-v1.0 items from [docs/Roadmap.md](docs/Roadmap.md):

| Roadmap Item | Proposed Flag(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Monorepo Affected-Detection | `--since=<git-ref>` on `resolve` | Skips unchanged `pokkum://` apps entirely based on git diffs. |
| Static/Prerendered Page Optimization (v1.0 — done) | `--static` on `build` | Builds a zero-JS-runtime image served by the embedded Go `pokkum-static` file server (no Bun runtime), plus a dedicated prerendered-page layer for the layered strategy. |
| Multi-Environment Management | `--target-env=<name>` on `build`/`resolve`/`apply` | Named `--target-env` to avoid colliding with `build`'s OTel `--telemetry-env`. |
| Hooks System | `pokkum hook pre-build`, `pokkum hook post-build`, `--skip-hooks` | Subcommands run hooks directly; `--skip-hooks` bypasses them during `build`. |
| Image Provenance Timeline | `pokkum history <image>`, `--output=json` | Reuses standard JSON envelope format. |
| Policy as Code | `pokkum policy check`, `--policy=<path>` | Rego/OPA policy file validation. |
| Service Mesh Integration | `pokkum mesh generate`, `--mtls`, `--mesh-telemetry` | Named `--mesh-telemetry` to remain distinct from OTel `--telemetry`. |
| Progressive Deployment Strategies | `pokkum deploy --canary=<percent>`, `--blue-green`, `--auto-rollback` | Canary and blue-green deployment specs. |
| Asset Optimization Pipeline | `--optimize-assets` on `build` | Opt-in asset minification/compression pipeline. |
| Plugin System | `pokkum plugin add\|list\|remove <name>` | Subcommand family for npm-based Pokkum CLI plugins. |

## 21. Open Naming Questions

Two proposed backlog flags above collide with already-shipped flags of the same short name (`--telemetry`, `--env`) because backlog notes in `docs/archive/AdditionalFeatures.md` predate the OTel work landing in v0.2. Resolve these before implementing the corresponding backlog item — do not ship a second, differently-scoped `--telemetry` or `--env`.
